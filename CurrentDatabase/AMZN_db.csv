  A complaint alleges Michelle Mack of Bonsall was the ringleader of an organized national crime ring that stole nearly $8 million worth of makeup and other goods from stores, including hundreds of Ulta Cosmetics stores across the U.S., and re-sold them on her online Amazon storefront. Days later, Mack texted her husband, “Even without Lancome we still did well,” and he texted her “Lots of orders let's get shipping.”
