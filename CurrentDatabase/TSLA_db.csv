  Tesla also sells a “key fob” for $175 for the Model 3 and Y , which comes with the S and X.
  Presumably, Musk agrees and envisions a way to unlock from his wrist, as well as a full-fledged app for the Apple Watch. You can create a shortcut for unlocking or locking your Tesla and then assign it to the action button on the Apple Watch Ultra or Ultra 2, or you can use it by asking Siri for it from any Apple Watch
  Either route, time will tell, but hopefully, Musk's “Sure” means that a Tesla Apple Watch app is on the horizon. Thus, anticipation is now spreading amongst Tesla and Apple Watch owners for the chance that the long-asked-for Apple Watch app is officially on the roadmap.

  The lawsuit was filed against the EV maker for fraudulently attracting customers through inflated advertisements regarding the distance traveled by the company's cars and SUVs on a single charge.
   ""Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service,"" the report stated.

  Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once technology visionaries on a joint mission to save the world from the threats of AI, have become embroiled in a fallout that has resulted in a lawsuit and the the publication of private emails.
   Elon Musk last week filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for chasing profit by partnering with Microsoft for $13 billion and keeping the code for its newest generative AI products a secret
  Sam Altman has been credited with turning OpenAI into a company with a $90billion valuation
  In March 2015 Altman and Musk teamed up to discuss their mutual fears about the risks AI could pose to humanity.

  Altman once looked up to Musk but the pair have since publicly fallen out
  Altman retaliated by revealing previously private emails from Elon Musk in an attempt to undermine the lawsuit.
   Musk replied: ‘Agree on all', according to the Journal.
  When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022 Musk irritated Altman by publicly stating that the chatbot had accelerated a dangerous race to develop powerful AI
  Former employees told the Journal that Musk was viewed internally as holding more influence and control than Altman.
