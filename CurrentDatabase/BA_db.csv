Nations around the world are rapidly developing high-energy laser weapons for military missions on land and sea, and in the air and space. The high-energy laser systems that are finding military applications are based on solid-state lasers that use special crystals to convert the input electrical energy into photons. Unlike traditional weapons such as guns and cannons that have a finite amount of ammunition, a high-energy laser can keep firing as long as it has electrical power.
  A U.S. Army Stryker armored fighting vehicle configured with a high-energy laser weapon, the extensions at the top rear of the vehicle. A key aspect of high-power solid-state lasers is that the photons are created in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and so cannot be seen by the human eye.

Taking a quick look at the world's largest commercial aircraft fleets, and cross-checking that against which satellites those airlines rely on, you find that Intelsat and Viasat largely dominate in deals with the top 25 or so global airlines, which together have over 7,000 planes. Satellite companies providing internet service to commercial airlines is one of the most mish-mashed sub-sectors of the space industry that I've come across over the years. My desk neighbor and CNBC's inimitable airline reporter Leslie Josephs, who kindly chipped in to this newsletter with her beat's side of the story, recently paid $19.99 for Wi-Fi on a cross-country Spirit flight – service she noted was fast enough for an hour-long video call.

2024-03-09,"SEATTLE — Boeing has acknowledged in a letter to Congress that it cannot find records for work done on a door panel that blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon two months ago.
  The safety board's chair, Jennifer Homendy, testified that for two months Boeing repeatedly refused to identify employees who work on door panels on Boeing 737s and failed to provide documentation about a repair job that included removing and reinstalling the door panel.
   Article content
  The company said its “working hypothesis” was that the records about the panel's removal and reinstallation on the 737 MAX final assembly line in Renton, Washington, were never created, even though Boeing's systems required it.
   The rivet repairs were done by contractors working for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, but the NTSB still does not know who removed and replaced the door panel, Homendy said Wednesday.
   Until the hearing, it said, “Boeing was not aware of any complaints or concerns about a lack of collaboration.”

  Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni made a separate comment after the interview, saying the pope had “picked up” on the imagery of the white flag after it was used by the interviewer. Ukrainian top diplomat pushed back on Pope Francis ' call for his country to show “the courage of the white flag” and enter negotiations
with Russia, a remark that fueled outrage among Ukrainians and condemnation from some foreign allies.
   “My Sunday morning take: One must not capitulate in face of evil, one must fight it and defeat it, so that the evil raises the white flag and capitulates,” Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on X.
  Ukraine's leadership has so far ruled out talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as Kyiv's military is strained by troop shortages and an ammunition deficit amid delays in receiving military aid from allies.

2024-03-10,"United Airlines left its mark on San Francisco when one of its flights took off Thursday … and almost immediately lost one of its tires, which came crashing down on parked cars at SFO Airport.
  Video captured the moment the Boeing 777 took off bound for LAX with 249 passengers aboard — before the jumbo jet's landing gear retracted into the fuselage, the massive tire flew loose right above an SFO employee parking lot.
   Once it was on the ground, United moved all the passengers to a new aircraft for the next leg of the flight … which is heading to Osaka Thursday evening.
  While there were no casualties from this incident, it's still concerning from the standpoint of it being yet another issue with a Boeing aircraft. As for the damaged plane, United says it landed safely at LAX, mainly because it's a 777, which has 6 tires on each of its 2 main landing gear struts. You'll recall, the door blew off a Boeing 737 , operated by Alaska Airlines, 2 months ago — leading to a temporary grounding of all 737 Max 9s.

The airline, which introduced its sleek new cabin last month, is weathering a storm of less-than-flattering comments on TikTok, which compare the design to “lawn chairs” and have customers asking if they need to bring their own seat cushions.
   Courtesy of Southwest Airlines
 They've been called the “Ozempic” of airline seats and compared to being as comfortable as “wooden benches,” but Southwest Airlines is defending its new slimmer seat design set to roll out next year.
   When the design was first introduced, Southwest's Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Tony Roach said the new cabin “significantly enhances our inflight Customer experience and will complement the amazing service that our Crews provide.”
  The decision to upgrade its cabin comes as Southwest continues mulling the idea of adding overnight red-eye flights, which CEO Bob Jordan has called a “logical evolution” for the airline.
   Another user saw the seats and immediately commented: “My back just flared up.”
  Following the criticism, a representative for Southwest told ABC News the “original images were 2D renderings to show the cosmetic look of the seats and were not scalable for illustrating seat comfort.”
  “But rest assured, we have our customers' back-even when they give us flak,” the airline added.
