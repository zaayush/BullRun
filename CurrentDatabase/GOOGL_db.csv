2024-03-08,"Fountainhead  Summary  Netflix has a deep moat with a massive $260Mn subscriber base, which is its biggest asset.
  Except for Amazon Prime, Disney, and You-Tube, this kind of audience scale is out of reach for the others, and a barrier to entry for aspiring competitors a) Who can't spare the cash b) And are hamstrung by other objectives or c) lack the focus to customize or scale programming
  Scale
  Netflix's CFO at an investors conference , spoke about content creation suggesting that both the top-down and bottom-up approach worked if it achieved scale, for a top-down approach they would identify market gaps for content and for a bottoms up approach if genre popularity was the reason they would see if the same genre could be used in other markets as well.
  Which is also useful to understand because when their fastest growing APAC market, which added 19% more subscribers YoY to 45Mn, struggles with pricing, it is the sheer scale that allows them to get decent operating margins by lower entry level pricing to get subscriptions. The virtuous cycle and network effect - a barrier to entry
  The virtuous circle
  One of the key competitive advantages that Netflix enjoys is the scale of its large member base of $260Mn subscribers, which works in leveraging content creation so that it can be used for more than one audience with similar demographics across different countries and languages - the kind that would be almost impossible for the likes of the studios and linear programmers to catch up with. Add Paramount's Yellowstone and The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) owned shows, like ""Lost"" and ""Grey's Anatomy
  Further, because of Netflix's massive reach of 260Mn subscribers, $17Bn programming spend and its excellent cash flow generation of $7.2Bn, which feeds the same spend, many competitors have to scramble to consolidate to make the most of their legacy content. This adds a ton of leverage to operating margins - content is amortized on an annual basis, it's not a cost of sales each time someone watches a show produced by Netflix, Since Netflix spends more on content than other streaming peers it has more popular hits, drawing even more subscribers - thus creating the virtuous cycle.

2024-03-10,"YouTube has changed the disclaimer attached to some abortion-related videos after a group of 16 attorneys general (AGs) sent a letter demanding the platform remove misleading information listed there. “Thanks to the leadership of state attorneys general calling out false information, YouTube has corrected its previously misleading notice.”
  He added, “Because of the FDA's reckless decision to end the requirement that chemical abortions be done by a licensed healthcare professional, women are now typically on their own when taking the drugs, without any direct medical supervision. The procedure is done by a licensed healthcare professional.”
  Are YouTube and its owners at Google advancing a pro-death agenda?
  This was criticized as being misleading, as — because of revised FDA protocols — women now undergo chemical abortions on their own, at home, without any medical supervision whatsoever.
   “Women deserve to know the truth about the risks posed by abortion drugs, which is why first-hand accounts like the ones ADF posted on YouTube are so vital,” he said. “Chemical abortion is the most common abortion method in the country, and women deserve to know the truth about these high-risk drugs that send, according to the FDA's own label, roughly one in 25 women who take them to the emergency room,” the letter continued.",negative,0.75,"Senior Counsel, Baptist, Action News, placenta, Chemical, emergency room, abortion, fetus, preborn child, CEO, pregnancy, Supreme Court, embryo, Google, Alphabet, Inc., Alphabet, Inc, Alphabet, letter, uterus, medicine, FDA, Live Action, Erik Baptist, YouTube, healthcare, women, Procedural, Yelp, Medication, medical abortion, misleading, abortion pill, drugs, ADF, information",2024-03-11,138.5,1.0727577902649046
