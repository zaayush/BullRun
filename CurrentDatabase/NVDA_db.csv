2024-03-07,"A chipmaker turns into a star.   The AI boom has, however, produced another contender in Jensen Huang, the 61-year-old CEO of Nvidia. One day after Huang announced that Nvidia had once again beaten analyst expectations, the company posted the largest single-session gain in value in market history. The only thing that may hold him back from achieving the generational, public-facing stardom of Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg is the nature of Nvidia's product. Rather than manufacture chatbots or self-driving cars themselves, Huang's company develops the fantastically intricate chips that make them possible.

2024-03-10,"India will emerge as one of the top five semiconductor ecosystems in world in the coming five years, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in an interview.
 “In coming five years, India is expected to witness about 4-6 more fabs, 6-10 compound semiconductor fabs, 1-2 display fabs, and 8-10 ATMP units. On the ₹ 10,372 crore India AI Mission that the Cabinet approved last week, the minister said its compute pillar is aimed at creating AI compute infrastructure of at least 10,000 GPUs or graphics processing units, which will be built through public-private partnerships.
   Tata Electronics Pvt. Ltd and Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will build a ₹ 91,000 crore semiconductor fab in Gujarat's Dholera, while Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Pvt. Ltd will set up an ATMP unit in Assam's Morigaon for ₹ 27,000 crore. We will do it in consultation with all stakeholders, as we did in case of Digital Personal Data Protection and Telecommunications 2023 bills.”

2024-03-11,"Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity (L), said he wasn't able to hire a Meta researcher because his company didn't have enough compute power. “By the time you waited and got the money and booked the cluster and got it, the guys working here will have already made the next-generation model,” Srinivas said, referring to AI talent at major tech companies.
   Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Meta have offered salaries as high as $900,000 a year to attract generative AI talent, and non-tech companies across the education, healthcare, and legal sectors have been looking to fill roles with workers who know how to use AI.
   ‘Come back to me when you have 10,000 H100 GPUs',” Srinivas said on a recent episode of the advice podcast “Invest Like The Best.”
  H100 GPUs refer to Nvidia's highly coveted graphic processing units that tech giants like Meta, OpenAI, and Google use in their data centers to power and train their AI chatbots.
   While Big Tech companies may employ workers who can create AI models that generate desirable outputs, Srinivas believes that skillset alone isn't enough to make AI tools useful.
