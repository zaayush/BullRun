Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Arm Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM).
   He noted strength in Nvidia's AI ramp through 2024 and 2025 with GH200, B100, B200 with his 2024 at ~$89 billion in Data Center revenues with potentially more upside and potentially, he estimated, reaching ~$280 billion in AI Data Center revenue by 2027 with strength also in ramps at peers Broadcom and AMD.
   Rakesh noted the potential for Broadcom to grow its AI revenues from an estimated $8 billion in 2024 to potentially as high as $20 billion in 2027 as it ramps up custom silicon solutions for customers. With AMD, Rakesh noted it as the second largest player in a continually expanding AI GPU market while still lagging behind Nvidia, as he said it could see 2024 AI revenue upside to ~$4-5billion (vs current estimates of $3.5 billion) but potentially ramping to ~$18 billion by 2027.

2024-03-09,"The question of prebuilt versus custom PC is one that's faced by nearly every PC owner at some point, be they enthusiast gamers or casual users.
 Custom PCs: pros
  You have full control over the parts that you pick
  If you choose your parts right, you can build a solid PC for less
  PC building can be a rewarding experience
  All components are new and replaceable, meaning future-proofing and upgradeability
  Custom PCs: cons
  You'll have to spend a long time researching
  Putting your PC together and troubleshooting can be stressful
  No warranty on the build, only on individual parts
  The operating system adds an extra cost
  It may take longer than buying a prebuilt
  What's the difference between prebuilts and custom PCs?
  Jacob Roach / Digital Trends
  Before getting into details, let's back out and define some terms. Some manufacturers use refurbished components
  Not cost-effective
  Occasional proprietary components make upgrading harder
  You can usually get a far better custom PC
  A lot of the components may be unknown
  Could experience issues if the PSU or the cooler isn't strong enough for the build
  With that out of the way, we'll go over the pros and cons of custom PCs.
   In a prebuilt that was made without much concern for the less “exciting” components, such as the cooler, the PSU, or the case (beyond its aesthetics), you may find that the PC underperforms at times. Recommended Videos
  Prebuilts vs. custom PCs: pros and cons

Introduction

A December 2023 article in The New Yorker does a thorough job introducing Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to readers. Most academic papers explaining new neural network innovations used CUDA acceleration by default when demonstrating experiments on GPUs.

Asked about competition from Analyst Joseph Moore at the March 2024 Morgan Stanley conference, CFO Kress talked about Nvidia's platform focus. He says Nvidia provides AI generation factories such that software can learn, understand and generate any information (emphasis added)::

We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. One of the reasons I'm not worried about this is because Nvidia's fiscal 2024 10-K said 40% of their fast-growing data center revenue was for AI inference.

 Nvidia's 2007 CUDA programming guide shows how GPUs devote more transistors to data processing than CPUs:
