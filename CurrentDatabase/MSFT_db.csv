  Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once technology visionaries on a joint mission to save the world from the threats of AI, have become embroiled in a fallout that has resulted in a lawsuit and the the publication of private emails.
   Elon Musk last week filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for chasing profit by partnering with Microsoft for $13 billion and keeping the code for its newest generative AI products a secret
  Sam Altman has been credited with turning OpenAI into a company with a $90billion valuation
  In March 2015 Altman and Musk teamed up to discuss their mutual fears about the risks AI could pose to humanity.

   Musk replied: ‘Agree on all', according to the Journal.
  When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022 Musk irritated Altman by publicly stating that the chatbot had accelerated a dangerous race to develop powerful AI

with Russia, a remark that fueled outrage among Ukrainians and condemnation from some foreign allies.

Introduction

A December 2023 article in The New Yorker does a thorough job introducing Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to readers. Most academic papers explaining new neural network innovations used CUDA acceleration by default when demonstrating experiments on GPUs.

Asked about competition from Analyst Joseph Moore at the March 2024 Morgan Stanley conference, CFO Kress talked about Nvidia's platform focus. He says Nvidia provides AI generation factories such that software can learn, understand and generate any information (emphasis added)::

We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. One of the reasons I'm not worried about this is because Nvidia's fiscal 2024 10-K said 40% of their fast-growing data center revenue was for AI inference.

 Nvidia's 2007 CUDA programming guide shows how GPUs devote more transistors to data processing than CPUs:
