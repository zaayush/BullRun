 WASHINGTON — For the ninth straight month, Earth obliterated global heat records — with February, the winter as a whole and the world's oceans setting new high-temperature marks, according to the European Union climate agency Copernicus.
  A report released by the Environmental Voter Project in December that looked at the patterns of registered voters in 18 different states found that after the Gen Z vote, people 65 and older represent the next largest climate voter group, with older women far exceeding older men in their propensity to list climate as their No. 1 reason for voting. The latest record-breaking in this climate change-fueled global hot streak includes sea surface temperatures that weren't just the hottest for February, but eclipsed any month on record — soaring past August 2023's mark and still rising at the end of the month.

 High ocean temperatures
 Record high ocean temperatures outside the Pacific, where El Nino is focused, show this is more than the natural effect, said Francesca Guglielmo, a Copernicus senior climate scientist.

  Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni made a separate comment after the interview, saying the pope had “picked up” on the imagery of the white flag after it was used by the interviewer. Ukrainian top diplomat pushed back on Pope Francis ' call for his country to show “the courage of the white flag” and enter negotiations
with Russia, a remark that fueled outrage among Ukrainians and condemnation from some foreign allies.
   “My Sunday morning take: One must not capitulate in face of evil, one must fight it and defeat it, so that the evil raises the white flag and capitulates,” Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on X.
  Ukraine's leadership has so far ruled out talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as Kyiv's military is strained by troop shortages and an ammunition deficit amid delays in receiving military aid from allies.
   It isn't the first time the Vatican has been forced to clarify comments from the 87-year-old pontiff on Russia and Ukraine.

Kate Meissner of Velocity Partners told Forrester, while there will be pitfalls this election year marketers should be diligent, staying within their guidelines, avoiding risks such as untested new media or unknown opportunities while avoiding any political discourse.
   Despite their best intentions, brands can become collateral damage if they don't take proactive measures this election cycle.”
  eMarketer projects U.S. political ad spending in 2024 to total a record $12.32 billion , surpassing the $10 billion threshold for the first time. Also, marketers should not alter their strategy by loading up on ads earlier in the year to avoid the onslaught of political messages just prior to the election.
