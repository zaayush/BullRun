It feels like we’ve been ruminating over tech layoffs for a long time now, but the onslaught keeps on coming. Alongside layoffs, Mike Ybarra, the Activision Blizzard president for the last two decades has left, and the production of its brand-new survival game Odyssey has been halted.

 For non-technical roles, a pivot is more straightforward, while engineers interested in game dev would do well to upskill or refresh their knowledge of C++, C#, JavaScript, Swift, Java, Lua and Python. To that end, the sports entertainment brand is hiring into roles across the board from engineers to artists and analysts. Netflix

 Revenue for Microsoft’s Windows-led personal computing business, which includes Xbox games and services, already grew 19% to 16.89 billion US dollars (£!3.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2023 - largely reflecting Activision Blizzard’s impact.

 On Thursday, Xbox president Sarah Bond announced that the first Activision Blizzard game on Xbox Game Pass will be Diablo IV, starting March 28.

 The demo was sent to staff before a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast, in which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed that four Xbox games will no longer be exclusive.

Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves and Grounded are currently available on PC and Xbox consoles, along with being on Xbox Game Pass.

It's worth considering whether devices with SIM functionality built-in might suit you better than the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro: both the Apple iPad Pro and the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 come with a SIM slot and are 5G compatible, for example, and both devices can be configured to act as Wi-Fi hotspots for other gadgets.
   The best wireless routers are perfectly fine when you're safe at home (as are the best mesh systems ), but what about when you're out and about?
That's where the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro comes in: it's a high-end mobile router that connects to cellular networks to provide the best mobile Wi-Fi hotspot anywhere.
   Our Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro review – which has included use in the UK, South Korea and the USA, to test its worldwide capabilities on different networks and bands – is comprehensive enough so you'll know for sure whether this pricey mobile router is the best option for you.

First, in Q2 of this year, we plan to reignite Bumble strength by relaunching Bumble app with a compelling modern experience geared toward capturing a broader audience and aimed at having a stronger appeal to younger users, using the profile creation experience, optimizing the core performance of the app and strengthening our AI capabilities to enhance fake account detection and brain profile picture insights to lead our customers to success faster.

2024-03-06,"OpenAI fired back at Musk, saying he supported the for-profit pivot and agreed not all of the science must be shared
 At a Glance
  OpenAI released emails with Musk showing that he supported their for-profit pivot and agreed some science cannot be shared.
   “We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired — someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI's mission without him,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, President Greg Brockman and other senior OpenAI executives in a blog post
  Tesla merger
  OpenAI rebutted Musk's claims that it violated its nonprofit founding pledge, saying that Musk knew of their plans and actually was “supportive” of OpenAI finding its own path.
   While Musk originally saw Google as the biggest threat, his lawsuit claims Microsoft is OpenAI's new AI overlord, even describing GPT-4 as “a de facto Microsoft proprietary algorithm.”
  Agrees to AI ‘being less open'
  In another rebuke to Musk's claims, OpenAI said he “understood the mission did not imply open-sourcing AGI.”
  Musk's lawsuit demanded that OpenAI become more open with GPT-4 just like it was more transparent with its earlier language models.
   Musk proposed OpenAI merge into Tesla, which will fund the AI startup. When OpenAI said no to giving up too much control to one person, Musk suggested OpenAI should merge with Tesla, since starting from scratch to catch up to Google seemed unrealistic.

2024-03-09,"(NEW YORK) The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday by Blakeman, a Republican, who said he believes the designation of separate athletic teams or sports based on sex assigned at birth “is necessary to maintain fairness for women's athletic opportunities.”
  “On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of women and girls in Nassau County, I have filed a federal lawsuit against @NewYorkStateAG to protect women's sports and ensure a safe environment for women,” Blakeman said in a post on X.
  In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for the attorney general's office called the executive order “transphobic and discriminatory.”
  “Our laws protect New Yorkers from discrimination, and the Office of the Attorney General is committed to upholding those laws and protecting our communities,” the statement said. “In addition to violating basic civil and human rights, the executive order will impose undue increased scrutiny on women's and girls' teams and leagues and will also subject all athletes on women's and girls' sports teams to intrusive and invasive questioning and other verification requirements.”
  Blakeman's lawsuit claims James' order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and asks the court to enjoin James' office from taking action against the county and Blakeman for implementing the executive order.
   Blakeman's lawsuit argues that the executive order is not a ban on transgender athletes competing in sports: “The Executive Order invites transgender biological males to compete except in teams and leagues that advertise or identify as exclusively all-girls or all-women.”
  “Women and Girls hard work, on-field achievements, and athletic futures deserve to be fostered, nurtured, and celebrated,” Blakeman stated in the executive order.
   The New York State Public High School Athletic Association's transgender policy states that it is “committed to providing all students with the opportunity to participate … in a manner consistent with their gender identity and the New York State Commissioner of Education's Regulations.”
  The governing bodies of several national and international sports leagues, including the International Olympic Committee, require transgender women to meet certain hormone levels in order to play on sports teams with cisgender women.
