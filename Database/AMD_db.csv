2024-02-14,"With games likes CS2, CoD MW2, PUBG, and Apex Legends all flagging the original version as cheat software, AMD has had to rework the feature.
 All has been quiet in the three months since that happened but today AMD’s chief architect of gaming solutions & marketing, Frank Azor, confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that “yes, [the feature was] coming soon.”
 Aimed at elevating the responsiveness of games, by reducing any potential CPU to GPU bottlenecks, AMD Anti-Lag+ is the sort of software feature that the company hopes will elevate the likes of its
 RX 7700 XT and RX 7600 XT to best graphics card entrants. AMD is set to bring back its AMD Anti-Lag+ feature, three months after it had to pull the plug on the technology following many users reports of the feature triggering bans in online games.
  The first version of AMD Anti-Lag+ was an ambitious attempt by the company to introduce a driver-level means by which to have games be able to reduce input lag through some clever CPU/GPU optimizations. With Nvidia in many ways leading the charge on software features with its own Nvidia Reflex anti-lag technology along with its DLSS suite of AI-enhanced upscaling and frame generating technologies, AMD clearly hoped Anti-Lag+ would help to bridge the gap, but that plan backfired.

2024-02-14,"Angi (ANGI) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why

What Happened:

Shares of home services online marketplace ANGI (NASDAQ: ANGI) jumped 23.1% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with adjusted EBITDA significantly beating Wall Street's estimates ($41.4 million vs. estimates of $28.6 million). The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock dropped 16.2% on the news that the company reported second quarter results, which missed analysts expectations for revenue and earnings per share. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Angi's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $174.17.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. What is the market telling us:

Angi's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 29 moves greater than 5%. Angi is up 24.2% since the beginning of the year, but at $2.98 per share it is still trading 26.9% below its 52-week high of $4.07 from July 2023.",negative,0.37,"revenue, rock, EBITDA, quarter, Angi, business, AMD, company, stock, Shares, AI, online marketplace, Wall Street, share, year, semiconductor, Nvidia, impact, NASDAQ",2024-02-15,173.87,-2.0174697097773935

2024-02-17,"Wall Street Futures surged Thursday on hopes & hypes of an early Fed rate cuts after softer than expected US retail sales in January (after upbeat
shopping/holiday season in Q4 and unusual cold weather in January). I don't see an imminent weakening in the job market
  · The Fed's challenge is that the labor market is good until it is not; need to look at other data
  · It's premature to think about just letting the economy run
  · Business contacts are not clamoring for rate cuts but want the decline in inflation to continue
  · Three cuts are a reasonable baseline for the year
  · Expectations for the economy remain close to where they were in December when most recent projections were set
  · I'm seeing ongoing progress on inflation that will move around month to month
  · All of the recent reports are within the bounds of recent volatility, and turning points are always bumpy
  · None of the recent data was surprising
  · We need more time and data to be sure of continued progress on inflation
  · Risks ahead include slower inflation progress & a faltering labor market
  · The Fed needs to resist the temptation to act quickly when patience is needed
  · There's more work to do on inflation
  · Remarkable progress on inflation is not a victory
  · Slowing inflation, without significant a decline in unemployment, is unequivocally good news
  · With positive data, I could support 3 cuts this year
  · I want to be careful about pushing balance sheet cuts (QT) too far
  · I was a little surprised by the January inflation data, but not in a big way
  · I don't see the market's urgency over lowering rates
  · The economy has lots of positive news
  · The economy still has tremendous momentum
  · I still expect two rate cuts in 2024
  · I am willing to pull the timing of rate cuts forward if data calls for it
  · My outlook is to start lowering rates in the summertime
  · I still expect the trend back to 2% inflation to be intact
  · People are feeling OK about the state of the economy
  · There's still more work to do to lower inflation pressures
  · I can live with the recent inflation data, the Fed should be patient on policy
  · I was a little surprised by the data (Jan'24 core CPI), but I have seen a lot of progress in inflation
  · Fed needs to resist the temptation to act quickly when patience is needed
  On Friday, Fed's Barr said:
  · I want to be flexible in conducting the Fed stress tests
  · Supervisors closely focused on commercial real estate risks
  · Regulators have downgraded bank ratings at a faster pace
  · The Fed is still exploring whether to require temporary higher capital and liquidity requirements for firms with trouble managing risk
  · Bank supervisors are closely focused on commercial real estate risks
  · Bank supervisors have issued more findings and downgraded bank ratings at a higher rate in the past year
  · Examiners conducting additional examinations of firms with large unrealized losses or other vulnerabilities
  On Friday, Fed's Barkin said:
  · CPI data confirms why the Fed needs more confidence to cut
  · January economic data has been messy, and not that good
   Market wrap:
  On Friday, Wall Street Futures, Gold tumbled after hotter than expected core PPI data and possible hotter core PCE data to be published in the month end; Fed will eventually set policy rate on average core inflation (PCE+CPI) and employment data. =0+2+2.50=4.50% (for 2024)
  Here:
  A=desired real interest rate=0.00; B= inflation target =2.00; C= permissible factor from deviation of inflation target=0; D= permissible factor from deviation of output target from potential=0.00; E= average core inflation for CY23
  Fed has to ensure a 2% price stability (core inflation) target keeping the unemployment rate below 4% and also 10Y bond yield below 5.00-4.50% so that borrowing cost for Uncle Sam remains manageable/sustainable to fund +34T debt (never-ending).
   On Friday, Fed's Bostic said:
  · I expect more progress on inflation but could be bumpy
  · Fed is likely to consider rate cuts soon but doesn't face urgency
  · U.S. economy less sensitive to interest rate changes
  · The US economy is in a good place
  · Inflation at 2% remains elusive
  · Economic Risks are Now More Balanced
  · January CPI not signaling a significant change in the trend of weakening inflation
  · Expects inflation to drop at a slower rate than what markets anticipate
  · Sees Fed making solid progress in lowering inflation
  · Fed is not urged to cut rates amid current economy
  · A strong economy justifies waiting to adjust monetary policy
  · Red Sea disruptions haven't much affected the US so far
  · If the economy performs well, I'm OK with waiting longer to cut
  · I was a little surprised by the January CPI report

While it would be nice to have ECC support on AMD's latest consumer Ryzen 8000G APUs, this is a technology typically reserved for AMD's Ryzen Pro processors. The technology also cannot be enabled on motherboards, so it looks like these processors indeed do not support ECC technology at all.

higher than green tea 4 to 5 times higher than black tea

“Although you can enjoy hot or cold cocoa, the hot version tends to trigger the release of more antioxidants than the cold version“, explained the researchers. Their tests included a cup of hot water containing two tablespoons of pure unsweetened cocoa powder (roughly the amount of cocoa in a regular-sized bag of instant hot chocolate), a cup of water containing a bag of green tea, a cup of black tea and a glass of red wine (a Merlot from California).

By DAMIAN J. TROISE – Associated Press
 NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia sparked a rally on Wall Street Thursday after the AI chipmaker reported another blowout quarter.
  Nividia surged 14.8% after reporting that its revenue and profit soared in the latest quarter thanks to booming demand for its chips used for artificial intelligence. Record gains in corporate earnings have enhanced the appeal of shares in Japanese companies, along with the weakness of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
  The big gain puts the benchmark index on track for another record high while pushing it higher for the week after two lackluster days.

 Macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a progressive form of vision loss that affects the center of what you see. Screening for Related Conditions
  During the slit lamp exam, ophthalmologists or optometrists also need to differentiate signs of dry AMD from diseases like vitelliform macular dystrophy, a genetic eye disorder, and retinal drug toxicity, which is damage to the eye due to medications, or many other conditions. Among the methods optometrists (eye doctors) or ophthalmologists (specialty eye doctors) use to diagnose macular degeneration are several kinds of eye tests and certain imaging techniques.

Su sold non-stock-option shares in a departure from her recent market activity, but the company says the distinction is a reach

 Silverman told MarketWatch that the selling of stock-option shares by company insiders ""is typically not a relevant valuation indicator"" but the pivot to non-option shares looks like ""a more opportunistic tack.""

""These are not options that expire so there's no need to sell them on any particular schedule,"" he added.

 Her latest activity is different because it marked the first time since 2019 that the AMD CEO dumped non-stock-option shares, said Ben Silverman, vice president of research at VerityData, in a recent report.

 Su holds options on 47,600 shares with a strike price of $12.83, which are due to expire in August and likely also part of her trading plan that extends through December, according to Silverman ""It's notable that she first chose to turn to non-option shares for liquidity rather than cashing in those soon-to-expire options,"" he said in his note.

What Happened:

Shares of clothing and accessories retailer Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) fell 14.1% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with same-store sales, revenue, and gross margin that missed analysts' expectations, leading to a bottom-line EPS miss vs. Wall Street's estimates. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Urban Outfitters's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,313.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. Specifically, revenue in the Anthropologie Group revenue segment fell below expectations, while sales in the Urban Outfitters segment came in ahead. Urban Outfitters is up 13.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $40.50 per share it is still trading 14.2% below its 52-week high of $47.18 from February 2024.

We're then told by RGT that Navi 48 should be cheaper than the RX 7900 GRE, which of course retails at $550 in the US. TDP will be around 260W, perhaps a bit lower at 250W.

With the caveat that this isn't final silicon yet, RGT believes that for overall performance, Navi 48 will a touch slower than the RX 7900 XT. For Navi 48, AMD is apparently targeting a clock speed of 3GHz or just over, perhaps more towards 3.5GHz (but that needs to be taken with a large grain of salt, RGT says, which you should do with all this info, really).

 Q4 is more likely on balance, but MLID really underlines that Blackwell GPUs are on track, hence why Q3 could be in the frame as a possibility - even if just to double down on NVIDIA's dominance in terms of the fastest desktop graphics cards, and 'crush' AMD.

 With AMD's RDNA 4 graphics cards not expected until perhaps Q3 of 2024 (or maybe Q4), this raises the possibility that NVIDIA could have the RTX 5090 out before Team Red's next generation of GPUs arrives.

 And that really would leave AMD eating NVIDIA's dust, although that said, even if RDNA 4 graphics cards do hit the shelves before the RTX 5090 - they won't remotely compete with it. As we've heard before from MLID, the likelihood is that the RTX 5090 will be 50% to 70% faster than the RTX 4090, making it a truly phenomenal performer when you consider how the existing Lovelace flagship graphics card already flies for frame rates.

2024-03-10,"NVIDIA and AMD are two of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world today. Two rival rulers bound by family ties

The rumor has been circulating on the Internet for several years, and neither Jensen Huang, the charismatic CEO of NVIDIA, nor Lisa Su, head of AMD, denied it. The difference in the career of the two is that, Unlike Lisa Su, Jensen Huang is one of the founders of the company he runs, which catapulted his fortune to the top of the richest people lists. Apparently, Jensen Huang’s mother is Lisa Su’s grandfather’s sisterso both are known in Chinese as biaojiuor cousins ​​separated by a generation.

2024-03-11,"Chetan Woodun  Summary  Cisco has partnered with Nvidia to help enterprises deploy AI infrastructures more rapidly while its acquisition of Splunk could be completed by the middle of this year.
  Nvidia's witnessing high demand for its H100 GPUs also plays to the advantage of Cisco's hyperscale-over-Ethernet AI switch and I identify around $3 billion of sales opportunities.
   Thus, besides the merger with Splunk, this thesis aims to value Cisco based on additional AI-related sales opportunities thanks to its networking gear being a key component for Nvidia's chips to be used in enterprise data centers.
   Second, even if companies like Super Micro and Dell may have a head start as OEMs as detailed in a recent thesis , one cannot ignore an all-rounder like Cisco, especially with the Nvidia partnership which could see more demand for its AI-driven observability solutions together with some server tailwind.
   Therefore, Nvidia's clients who want to connect clusters of H100s to deliver high-speed switching (with low latency) needed for AI models to function optimally and according to their data center standards can use Cisco's hyperscale over Ethernet AI fabric, a functionality provided by the Silicon One switch.

2024-03-11,"This month, HP stunned the market with the most powerful line of AI-enabled PCs and workstations yet to be created, catching the other OEMs, which have been more tentative and less complete, by surprise. It is through this unique depth of relationship and NVIDIA’s leadership that HP was able to create a solution that any other OEM using a similar process could have done but didn’t because of the historical lack of inter-company cooperation preventing this level of outside company influence and collaboration.

 The NVIDIA/HP Partnership

What was presented at HP Amplify this month was unique in that HP’s leadership asked NVIDIA to help with the product strategy, so the leadership for the announced effort came from that company, not HP, and led not only to a more executable vision but a more complete offering that includes well-thought-through support elements. This was only possible due to a unique relationship between Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, and HP, since much of the solution was built because of NVIDIA’s direct guidance. However, there was a gap in that toolset, and he prevailed on HP to create AI Studio, a hardware-independent (HP is building a software company in a company) toolset uniquely useful to data scientists building Large Language Models (LLMs) and their related generative AI solutions.
