2024-02-13,"United Airlines briefly grounded its fleet of brand-new Airbus A321neo planes, according to a report by Gizmodo. United is seeking permission from the FAA to add the Airbus A321neo to the pre-existing exemption. The company's Airbus A321neo is so new that it doesn’t fall under the protection of that exemption. It costs around $130 million to manufacture just one A321neo aircraft, so United spent $650 million to make this fleet.

2024-02-13,"CFO Brian West believes repositioning the talent currently reworking planes can help it improve production quality.
  Speaking today at Cowen Aerospace & Defense Conference, West noted,
  “We had, at the end of last year, 50 airplanes that required rework, and those 50 airplanes we expect to move through the rework this year and gives us the ability to shut down that shadow factory.”
  “Not every one of those 50 will fly away by the end of the year … But the important point is that the rework will be complete; it allows us to shut down the shadow factory and move the labor from reworking airplanes to working on new production.”

  Boeing's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Brian West believes the company is getting close to a stage where it can close its 787 shadow factory, repointing that labor at new production to the benefit of the company. Boeing needs to address quality control and production processes before closing the shadow factories, but closing them will put them in a strong position when production ramps up.

 Resneck, a California dermatologist, emphasized pending bills in Indiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming that include several policies backed by the AMA, including quicker response times, requirements for public reporting of insurers’ prior authorization determinations, and programs to reduce the volume of requests, sometimes called “gold carding.” In 2018, health insurers signed a consensus statement with various medical facility and provider groups that broadly laid out areas for improving the prior authorization process.

shopping/holiday season in Q4 and unusual cold weather in January). I don't see an imminent weakening in the job market
  · The Fed's challenge is that the labor market is good until it is not; need to look at other data
  · It's premature to think about just letting the economy run
  · Business contacts are not clamoring for rate cuts but want the decline in inflation to continue
  · Three cuts are a reasonable baseline for the year
  · Expectations for the economy remain close to where they were in December when most recent projections were set
  · I'm seeing ongoing progress on inflation that will move around month to month
  · All of the recent reports are within the bounds of recent volatility, and turning points are always bumpy
  · None of the recent data was surprising
  · We need more time and data to be sure of continued progress on inflation
  · Risks ahead include slower inflation progress & a faltering labor market
  · The Fed needs to resist the temptation to act quickly when patience is needed
  · There's more work to do on inflation
  · Remarkable progress on inflation is not a victory
  · Slowing inflation, without significant a decline in unemployment, is unequivocally good news
  · With positive data, I could support 3 cuts this year
  · I want to be careful about pushing balance sheet cuts (QT) too far
  · I was a little surprised by the January inflation data, but not in a big way
  · I don't see the market's urgency over lowering rates
  · The economy has lots of positive news
  · The economy still has tremendous momentum
  · I still expect two rate cuts in 2024
  · I am willing to pull the timing of rate cuts forward if data calls for it
  · My outlook is to start lowering rates in the summertime
  · I still expect the trend back to 2% inflation to be intact
  · People are feeling OK about the state of the economy
  · There's still more work to do to lower inflation pressures
  · I can live with the recent inflation data, the Fed should be patient on policy
  · I was a little surprised by the data (Jan'24 core CPI), but I have seen a lot of progress in inflation
  · Fed needs to resist the temptation to act quickly when patience is needed
  On Friday, Fed's Barr said:
  · I want to be flexible in conducting the Fed stress tests
  · Supervisors closely focused on commercial real estate risks
  · Regulators have downgraded bank ratings at a faster pace
  · The Fed is still exploring whether to require temporary higher capital and liquidity requirements for firms with trouble managing risk
  · Bank supervisors are closely focused on commercial real estate risks
  · Bank supervisors have issued more findings and downgraded bank ratings at a higher rate in the past year
  · Examiners conducting additional examinations of firms with large unrealized losses or other vulnerabilities
  On Friday, Fed's Barkin said:
  · CPI data confirms why the Fed needs more confidence to cut
  · January economic data has been messy, and not that good
   Market wrap:
  On Friday, Wall Street Futures, Gold tumbled after hotter than expected core PPI data and possible hotter core PCE data to be published in the month end; Fed will eventually set policy rate on average core inflation (PCE+CPI) and employment data. =0+2+2.50=4.50% (for 2024)
  Here:
  A=desired real interest rate=0.00; B= inflation target =2.00; C= permissible factor from deviation of inflation target=0; D= permissible factor from deviation of output target from potential=0.00; E= average core inflation for CY23
  Fed has to ensure a 2% price stability (core inflation) target keeping the unemployment rate below 4% and also 10Y bond yield below 5.00-4.50% so that borrowing cost for Uncle Sam remains manageable/sustainable to fund +34T debt (never-ending).
   On Friday, Fed's Bostic said:
  · I expect more progress on inflation but could be bumpy
  · Fed is likely to consider rate cuts soon but doesn't face urgency
  · U.S. economy less sensitive to interest rate changes
  · The US economy is in a good place
  · Inflation at 2% remains elusive
  · Economic Risks are Now More Balanced
  · January CPI not signaling a significant change in the trend of weakening inflation
  · Expects inflation to drop at a slower rate than what markets anticipate
  · Sees Fed making solid progress in lowering inflation
  · Fed is not urged to cut rates amid current economy
  · A strong economy justifies waiting to adjust monetary policy
  · Red Sea disruptions haven't much affected the US so far
  · If the economy performs well, I'm OK with waiting longer to cut

By Jan Tegler

A KC-10 performs its final mission in 2020

Air Force photo

The Air Force has yet to determine a strategy for buying new aerial refueling aircraft that will replace much of its aged KC-135 fleet.

 But she added that the Air Force is exploring how it could potentially leverage commercial aerial refueling in the future, revealing that the service’s transition from legacy tankers to the KC-46A and the aircraft that will be procured under the tanker recapitalization program does strain capacity.

 Hafer said that Boeing’s hot KC-46 production line and its ability to quickly transition to building upgraded Pegasus tankers for recapitalization offers “the most economically beneficial solution for the U.S. Air Force.”

“We’ll emphasize that it’s very important to keep production rolling if the Air Force decides to go with the KC-46,” he said. Also in question is whether the number of aircraft purchased as part of the tanker recapitalization program will provide sufficient capacity until the service’s Next-Generation Air-Refueling System program, known as NGAS, becomes operational.

 

Late last September, the Air Force issued a formal request to industry for information on tanker recapitalization with an approved requirement for up to 140 aircraft.",neutral,0.53,"fiscal year, dovetail, KC-10, “Overall, RVS, Ann Stefanek, Limbo, jet, program, Brian Brackens, Alexandria, Control, airborne, Lockheed, aircraft, Aboulafia, Washington, D.C., Stefanek, Air Force, Force, A330 MRTT, F-16s, KC-46, bow, AeroDynamic Advisory, recapitalization, logistics, A330, Andrew Hunter, boom operator, Tim Walton, encryption, United States, Congress, Jacksonville, Walton, Jan Tegler, A-10s, Auto’Mate, tanker, hedge, unit conversion, AMC, Metrea, KC-135, Martin, bill, Block 1, proof-of-concept, 1st Lt, Hunter, Christmas, procurement, Omega, Washington, D.C, Lockheed Martin, U.S, management systems, Boeing, refueling, KC-46A Pegasus, Frank Kendall, Richard Aboulafia, Mike Hafer, line-of-sight, Airbus, KC-46As, prohibition, Hafer, Hudson Institute, aerial refueling, MRTT, digital, service, award, air refueling, Peyton Craven, KC-46A, Virginia, ND

  According to RTX, it estimates that the total value from upgrades and future aircraft development will be around $40 billion by 2030
  Pratt & Whitney
  Pratt and Whitney is a leading engine supplier for military and civilian aviation customers, and it provides fleet management and aftermarket overhaul services.
   The company's Collins Aerospace segment is experiencing growth in market share and aftermarket overhauling business, while Pratt & Whitney benefits from engine sales and maintenance visits.
