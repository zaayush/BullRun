An El Paso County man is in jail on suspicion of first-degree murder after allegedly shooting the father of his fiancee’s child shortly before 3 p.m. on Feb. 11 in northwestern Elbert County.
  The affidavit says Elbert County Sheriff’s Office dispatch, which was receiving information from the scene while deputies were en route, advised that Bolan “appeared to be beyond help” after the shooting and that Church had placed the handgun in his vehicle after the shooting but remained on the scene. Jeffrey Allen Church, 26, who lives north of Black Forest in El Paso County, allegedly shot and killed Parker resident Michael Bolan, 36, outside the Valero gas station located on Elbert County Road 166 (Singing Hills Road) near Madrid Drive.
  The sheriff’s deputy who transported Church to the Elbert County Jail noted in the affidavit: “During this transport Jeffrey only made one statement, asking where his kids were.”
 Church exercised his rights not to speak with Elbert County investigators at the jail, where he was booked on a charge of first-degree murder. A sheriff’s office press release and the affidavit describe the first deputy from Elbert County and a Douglas County deputy arriving at the Valero and holding Church at gunpoint until other Elbert County deputies arrived and Church was taken into custody.",neutral,0.47,"Michael Bolan, fight, handgun, Amazon, Chevrolet, deputy, Jeffrey, Valero, custody, District Court, first-degree murder, Chevrolet Tahoe, sheriff, dashcam, Elbert, Witnesses, gas station, Black Forest, Madrid, Jail, affidavit, Elbert County, Parker, semiautomatic handgun, Douglas County, AdventHealth, Bolan, ”

 On the surface, there appears to be very little difference between these two sterling sub-249g mini drones, but delve into the specs, and there's a surprising smorgasbord of fundamental variations between the two.
   Verdict
  This writer has learned a lot during the extra research on these two drones and my overriding opinion is that the DJI Mini 4 Pro is far and away the better drone in everything bar general flight characteristics, which are essentially the same.
   Pilot interface
   DJI Mini 4 Pro
  For the sake of this comparison, we shall compare the Mini 4 Pro's RC 2 controller to the Mini 3 Pro's RC controller since they are, in my opinion, a better choice than the standard phone-mount variants. The Mini 3 Pro was launched in May 2022 and is available now at DJI in two main configurations – the DJI RCN1 version (£639/ $759/ AU$ 1,119), which comes with DJI's standard phone-mount controller and the DJI RC, which ships with DJI's RC all-in-one controller (£859/ $909/ AU$1,299).

 Indeed, he burst onto the international music scene as a teen phenom, and now his fascinating rise to stardom will be chronicled in a new full-length documentary, Kids Are Growing Up: A Story About A Kid Named Laroi
  The film is set to premiere on Amazon's Prime Video on February 29, and a trailer is out now.
   A press release notes of the movie:
  “ Kids Are Growing Up tells the intimate story of Charlton ‘The Kid Laroi' Howard who went from an unknown musician living in Australia to a teenage global superstar selling out his hometown arena on back-to-back nights in just three years. The film captures a unique moment in time, as Laroi enters adulthood, navigating the pressures of rapid fame, struggles with his mental health, first love, and the tragic death of his mentor — the late great Juice WRLD. As Laroi is forced to deal with problems greater than his age, he searches for what happiness truly means, and how to handle outsized expectations from the public, those closest to him, and himself.”

JD.com is thus not a risk-free company at all, but for someone looking for China exposure, JD.com could nevertheless make sense in a diversified portfolio -- the valuation is so low that even moderate business growth could result in great total returns in the long run. JD.com: Very Inexpensive

JD.com has a good chance of reporting better-than-expected results, but the company will not showcase any extraordinary or explosive business growth for sure. While this would represent a decline compared to the previous year's period, it is very important to note that the analyst consensus estimate has been pretty far from target in the past: JD.com has beaten the consensus earnings per share estimate by 15%, 9%, 35%, and 38% over the last four quarters, respectively [see Seeking Alpha page linked above]. Of course, higher growth would be better, but even in a no-growth or low-growth scenario, JD.com could be an appealing investment as the market currently prices JD.com as if its earnings were about to decline into perpetuity.

In a follow-up with Den Of Geek at SXSW 2024, Nolan confirmed that the show, which takes place about a decade after the latest chronological installment (Fallout 4, set in 2287) is entirely its own original story that is at least partially informed by what game series’ director Todd Howard has told him not to do. Advertisement

Nonetheless, Nolan has since tamped down the rumor mill, clarifying that the Fallout show is not in fact replacing the next game, and is actually steering well clear of it. I don’t want to sound presumptuous, but it’s just a non-interactive version of it, right?”

The quote made the rounds as gamers anxiously assumed that the show was somehow going to take the place of an official Fallout 5 game from Bethesda, even though the studio has already tacitly confirmed its existence and that it’s set to arrive sometime after the next Elder Scrolls game, which means it’s still many years off. Co-creator Jonathan Nolan recently claimed that the upcoming series was essentially “Fallout 5,” which set off some alarms for folks for some reason.
