2024-02-17,"If you think artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are starting to look frothy, you're not the only one.

 If you think the rapid surge in AI stock prices is a warning sign for investors, you might want to consider the advice of George Soros, the billionaire investor and chairman of Soros Fund Management who is one of the most successful investors ever. AI stock investors should be wary of a bubble forming and should keep an eye on these stocks and others, making sure that the results from the businesses justify the gains, but it also seems that at this stage, momentum in the AI hardware sector is still building. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) reported an exceptional top-line beat and raise to finish off eFY24 with high sales growth and margin strength. In terms of business strength, I believe Arm will experience strong, high-quality growth both at the top and bottom line in eFY24 and eFY25; however, I do not believe that the growth justifies this premium, especially when compared to peer semiconductor designers like Nvidia (NVDA). Even if smartphone sales remain flat in CY24, Arm will reap benefits from sales of the higher end devices as every premium smartphone model will be using V9, resulting in higher royalties on the flat volumes. On the consumer side, I believe that the broader market might be overly-optimistic in terms of growth for CY24 (eFY25) as consumers continue to face high inflation rates across everyday items that may impact spending in electronics. I believe the firm will experience strong tailwinds on higher-value chipsets as more firms adopt advanced infrastructure to run AI applications.",neutral,0.98,"Nvidia, smartphone, inflation rate, OECD, NASDAQ, strength, Operations

2024-02-26,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  As I pointed out in a previous column, the Street has become significantly
less fearful of small-cap stocks and medium-cap stocks than in 2022 and the first 10 months of 2023. Also importantly, a huge percentage of small-cap and mid-cap names got crushed in 2022 and the first 10 months of 2023, so the impact of higher rates was more than reflected in their stocks. The Real Reasons for the Underperformance
  Many pundits and traders have said that the Russell 2000 underperformed because of the inferior fundamentals of small-cap names and because higher interest rates are hurting smaller firms more than larger ones.
   Therefore, I believe as the Street becomes more bullish and less afraid of high interest rates, small-cap and mid-cap stocks will rally.

  Negatives/risks
  Massive Capex and investment required to keep pace with demand
  $600M financing and still need for more working capital
  Competition
  AI inferencing moving to the edge
  Low gross margin
  Low operating margin
  Valuation
  Capital needs
  Capacity expanded to 4K racks per month and is likely to reach 5K per month at the end of FY24 (June/24).
   Margins
  Non-GAAP gross margin took a 150bp hit to 15.5% because of a 65% utilization rate and what we believe is using pricing to gain new customers (Q2/24CC):
  The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.5%, which was down quarter-over-quarter from 17% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs and gaining market share.
   ""Growth was driven by AI/GPU and rack-scale total IT solutions, which again represented over 50% of total revenues this quarter, with AI/GPU revenues in both the enterprise/channel and the OEM appliance/large data center verticals."" Capacity expanded to 4K racks per month
  The guidance is remarkable as it implies sequential growth in Q3 (which is normally the seasonally weak quarter) and the implied guidance for Q4 is $4.82B.
  The FY24 revenue guidance is a huge increase from the previous $10-$11B range.

one stock that can generate portfolio- and life-changing returns, sometimes very quickly. Like Nvidia's AI chips, customers are flocking to Supermicro for their AI needs:
  Management is basing this on its internal data and industry data from Gartner . At a forward P/E ratio of just 40, Supermicro's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, signaling that the stock is still a bargain for its expected future growth potential.
   In other words, investors see how much Supermicro has climbed over the past year and assume that the stock must be expensive. However, the data and recent financial performance indicate a bright future for Super Micro Computer and its shareholders.

Thesis Summary

 In this article, I compare Nvidia and SMCI in terms of their Moat, Profitability, Growth and Valuation in order to determine which is the better investment

Moat

Every great company needs a “moat.” While SMCI has done well in the last year, it has less moat and low margins and is trading at an even higher premium than Nvidia.

 If Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) is the Kind of AI, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has now taken its place next to it as queen.

 It is perhaps the best at the moment, and it has strong ties to the main chip manufacturers, but there’s also another reason why SMCI is a popular choice, and this actually proves that the company does not have such a great moat as Nvidia.

With a Price to Earnings ratio of 88.0 , which is 0.84x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants.

 Key Takeaways

The PE, PB, and PS ratios for Super Micro Computer indicate that the company is undervalued compared to its peers in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. With a Price to Book ratio of 20.45 , which is 2.1x the industry average, Super Micro Computer might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers.

 The company's revenue growth of 103.25% is notably higher compared to the industry average of -1.67%, showcasing exceptional sales performance and strong demand for its products or services.

  Nvidia's witnessing high demand for its H100 GPUs also plays to the advantage of Cisco's hyperscale-over-Ethernet AI switch and I identify around $3 billion of sales opportunities.
   Thus, besides the merger with Splunk, this thesis aims to value Cisco based on additional AI-related sales opportunities thanks to its networking gear being a key component for Nvidia's chips to be used in enterprise data centers.
   Second, even if companies like Super Micro and Dell may have a head start as OEMs as detailed in a recent thesis , one cannot ignore an all-rounder like Cisco, especially with the Nvidia partnership which could see more demand for its AI-driven observability solutions together with some server tailwind.
   Therefore, Nvidia's clients who want to connect clusters of H100s to deliver high-speed switching (with low latency) needed for AI models to function optimally and according to their data center standards can use Cisco's hyperscale over Ethernet AI fabric, a functionality provided by the Silicon One switch.
