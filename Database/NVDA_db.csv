ChatGPT’s traffic is increasing again after declining throughout the summer, according to new estimates from third-party firms, in perhaps the clearest indication yet that the chatbot’s usage is directly impacted by the school calendar in the US.

A third analytics firm, Sensor Tower, said that weekly worldwide ChatGPT app users grew by more than 10 per cent in both of the last two weeks of August, when a large portion of the US returned to school. The firm studied users believed to be students because they frequented education-related domains, and found traffic from that student group to ChatGPT grew by 21 per cent compared to 8 per cent for users outside of that group. The recent traffic bump, which comes as school is back in session in the US, may revive concerns around how widespread ChatGPT use is among students, who can turn to the AI tool to generate code and summarize notes in a matter of seconds as well as write term papers and other assignments.

 While the advent of Metaverse is seen as a major step in the crypto frontier, a report released by NYU Stem Center for Business and Human Rights (CBHR) warned that these developments could lead to an unprecedented erosion of privacy and a rapid surge in physical aggression.
   The report said in part:
  “Given the real-time, ephemeral nature of interactions in VR, proactive detection is the only way to catch and address certain dangerous activities like child sexual exploitation and terrorist recruitment before they cause irreparable harm.”
  This report further advised governments to develop comprehensive federal privacy legislation while strengthening their authority to oversee digital industries, including the Metaverse.
   CBHR's report recommends adopting solid steps by both the Web3 space and governments to avert a looming security and privacy crisis.
   The report reads;
  “The types and volumes of data that XR devices can collect make them several orders of magnitude more invasive than traditional web-tracking and surveillance technologies.”
  CBHR believes attackers and advertisers could exploit this information for commercial or political gain, eroding privacy. Secondly, CBHR advises the industry to offer more options for users to control their exposure to privacy and safety risks, incorporating privacy and safety best practices and investing in automation tools for proactive moderation in 3D virtual environments.

2023-09-28,"Wall Street Futures and gold were already under stress, while USD/US bond yield surged since the Fed's more hawkish than expected hold on 20th
September and subsequent hawkish comments by various Fed policymakers, indicating a higher for longer stance. On Wednesday, Fed's Kashkari again popped up and said:
  · A government shutdown and auto strike may slow the economy
  · There is a risk interest rates might have to go higher, but it's hard to know
  · The resilience of the US economy has been surprising
  · I expect the Fed to hold rates steady next year
  · The Fed is not trying to create a recession
  · Hopefully, the Fed has done enough on rates, but we don't know
  · Higher oil prices won't alone warrant more rate hikes
  · The Fed has made a lot of progress on inflation
  · The neutral rate may have moved up
  · We are allowing the data to drive Fed decisions
  · Economic data suggests the Fed is not as restrictive as it appears
  · Consumer spending has stayed robust
  · I don't know if Fed policy is restrictive enough
  · I don't know yet if the Fed is done or needs to go higher
  · I am open to the possibility that we may need more than one hike
  After Fed's ultra-hawkish St. Louis Fed President Bullard quits mid-August, it seems that the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari, another known hawk has taken over Bullard's role, who has advocated for a terminal rate around 5.50-5.75%, if not +6.00% to bring U.S. core inflation back to +2.00% targets in a sustainable way by 2024-25.
   Given these developments, what is my current outlook?
  I see us facing two primary scenarios going forward:
  Soft landing: After potentially one more 25-basis-point federal funds rate increase later this year, the FOMC holds policy at this level long enough to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable period of time. Fed never surprised the market with its rate action and by mid-October (after core inflation and labor/wage data for September), it will be clear whether the Fed will go for another +25 bps hike in Nov'23 before going for a final pause in Dec'23.
   But, if core CPI inflation indeed eased further to below +4.0% by Oct'23, then the Fed may refrain from any further rate hike in 2023 and may also indicate some rate cuts in Q2CY24 in the Dec'23 SEP (ahead of the US Presidential Election in Nov'24) to keep real repo rate around +1.00% levels (restrictive zone).

The European Commission has been informally collecting views on potentially abusive practices in the sector for so-called graphics processing units, to understand if there could be the need for future intervention, people familiar with the matter said.
  The move from the bloc’s antitrust enforcers comes after the French competition watchdog earlier this week announced that it had raided the offices of a company suspected of engaging in “anticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector.”
 Nvidia’s dominant role in supplying chips for artificial intelligence tasks is coming under closer scrutiny from regulators.

 In a keynote address at the Intel Innovation 2023 event that opened in San Jose on September 19, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company’s 2nm process (20A, or 20 angstroms, which equals 2 nanometers) will be production-ready in the first half of 2024 and its 18A process in the second half of the same year.

 Compared to Intel 4, Intel 3 promises an 18% higher performance per watt efficiency, denser high-performance library, reduced via resistance, and increased intrinsic drive current.”

Intel 3 process technology will be used in the volume production of the new data center and server processors at Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest scheduled for next year. The same goes for Intel 4… [which is] the first of Intel’s fabrication processes to make use of extreme ultraviolet [EUV] lithography… With that said, where things become very interesting is with 20A and 18A. 20A (the company’s 2nm process) is said to be where Intel will reach “process parity.” Chip architects will have the ability to pack more tiles – also called chiplets – in a smaller footprint on one package, while achieving performance and density gains with greater flexibility and lower overall cost and power usage.”

Compared with the organic packaging materials (epoxy resin, etc.) used today, “glass offers distinctive properties such as ultra-low flatness and better thermal and mechanical stability, resulting in much higher interconnect density in a substrate.”

Intel said it has started ""an extensive internal and external search"" to replace Rivera, who currently oversees the company's data center and artificial intelligence chip business that competes with
 Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices
  During a conference call with investors, Rivera said the unit is increasingly using Intel's factories rather than the factories in Taiwan where its chips were previously made. ""We're setting this up to really have a unique advantage by leveraging Intel.""

 JERUSALEM – Israeli stock and bond prices slid and many businesses were closed on Sunday, October 8, a day after Hamas gunmen from Gaza killed hundreds of Israelis and abducted an unknown number of others.
   Gaza militants also fired thousands of rockets into Israel, some reaching as far as Tel Aviv, prompting airlines to suspend flights to and from Israel
  Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he had directed heads of ministry departments to quickly provide the budgets required to help manage the war
  The Bank of Israel said it was too soon to assess the economic damage from the conflict but pointed to a 50-day war with Hamas militants in Gaza in 2014 that caused damage of 3.5 billion shekels, or 0.3% of gross domestic product. Key Tel Aviv share indices ended nearly 7% lower, led by a 9% drop in banking shares on turnover of 2.2 billion shekels ($573 million), and government bond prices fell as much as 3% in the market's initial response to the bloodiest attack on Israel in decades.
  While the foreign exchange market is closed on Sundays, the shekel is already at its weakest level of the year due to a highly contested government plan to overhaul the judiciary.
   “The shekel will most likely weaken sharply tomorrow and we see a high probability that at some point the Bank of Israel will sell FX.”
  Gunmen from the Palestinian group Hamas rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday, October 7, killing at least 400 Israelis, before abducting dozens of hostages and returning to Gaza.

2023-10-12,"Creative software giant Adobe has been walking a bit of a tightrope when it comes to generative AI: while it has embraced the technology to release
a host of new features for its users, such as the well-received Generative Fill in Photoshop and Firefly text-to-image generator (both unveiled in spring 2023), it has faced criticism from some contributors to its Adobe Stock image service , who say the company took advantage of its permissive terms-of-service to allow it to train its proprietary AI models on their work without advance knowledge or direct compensation.
   In fact, this week at its annual Adobe MAX conference in Los Angeles, Adobe has announced a host of new AI products, services, and features, including its all-new “ Firefly Image 2, ” which includes improved prompt understanding and greater photorealism, putting it right up against other leading generative AI models such as Midjourney and the recently released DALL-E 3 from OpenAI , now integrated into ChatGPT Plus.
  While Firefly 2 doesn't offer baked in-typography like DALL-E 3 or rival Ideogram does, it does offer some other unique and enterprise-grade features.
   Rights and indemnification
  Notably, in order to discourage misuse or use of another artist's copyrighted imagery for unauthorized use by an individual, brand, or enterprise, Adobe says “Generative Match automatically prompts users with an in-app message, requiring them to confirm they have rights to use uploaded images as well as agree to Adobe's Terms of Use.”
  While this confirmation may not prevent bad actors from simply lying and proceeding to use the tool, it shows Adobe's attempt to be complaint with copyright, an ongoing contentious issue in the age of generative AI, with numerous creatives suing other companies such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms (parent of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, among others) for training on their material without express permission, authorization, or compensation.
   In fact, Adobe's new product announcements at MAX this week are replete with many mentions of and gestures toward respecting copyright, including this: “Firefly Image 2 is trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, and public domain content where the copyright has expired.”
  Don't forget, Adobe is one of the short list of companies offering AI tools along with indemnification — that is, compensating or defending users who face claims for the use of said AI tools. As Adobe states in its news release: “Generative Match enables users to either pick images from a pre-selected list or upload their own reference image to guide the style when generating new images…Users can easily meet brand guidelines or save time designing from scratch by replicating the style of an existing image, and quickly maintain a consistent look across assets.”
  This feature intensifies the already growing rivalry between Adobe, the longtime leader of creative software for visual artists and designers since the dawn of the PC age, and Canva, which over the last decade since launch has won a huge following courting the “everyone else” of the equation, those without art degrees who nonetheless need to create visual material, such as marketers and communications professionals.

Introduction

After reporting a double miss for Q3 2023, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is down -3.5% to $234 per share in the after-hours session at the time of writing. Concluding Thoughts

With higher interest rates (low affordability) the demand for new autos is waning, and Tesla is clearly feeling the heat, with revenue growth decelerating rapidly and margins contracting significantly in Q3 2023.

 TSLA's Technical And Quant Rating Analysis

In Tesla Stock: A $100 Move Is Imminent, I shared a cautiously bearish stance for TSLA with the stock trading at ~$270 at the time:

The bull-bear debate around Tesla being a technology or an auto company continues to rage on, with TSLA's price action getting tighter and tighter in a triangle formation marked in the chart below - Tesla stock chart 9/12/2023 (WeBull Desktop) Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if bearish investors/traders start labeling Tesla as ""just another car company"" in light of these disappointing Q3 earnings and call for a de-rating in TSLA to an auto stock valuation.

   Huawei's Ascend AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's in terms of raw computing power, analysts and some AI firms such as China's iFlyTek say, but they still lag behind in performance.
   While Nvidia has historically been the leading provider of AI chips in China with a market share exceeding 90 percent, Chinese firms including Huawei have been developing their own versions of Nvidia's best-selling chips, including the A100 and the H100 graphics processing units (GPU).

  While the largest deals have gone to closed proprietary models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, there has been a surge of startups betting big on an open-source future.

   ""There's been this significant proliferation.”
  Open-source models represent the biggest challenge to proprietary LLM providers since generative AI's initial explosion in popularity late last year. Switching to these open-source models, VCs are betting, will drive down costs set by the big LLM providers and will lower the barriers to entry.

  There will be plenty of Nintendo Switch 2 rumors flying around over the coming months, and two more have now turned up. While one rumor gives the console an unexpected name and claims the dock will not be present, the other patent-based rumor suggests a dividable Switch 2 with two displays for multiplayer gaming. This rather far-fetched rumor also claims that the name for the console is actually Nintendo Super Play.
  While there could be some argument for Nintendo either losing the dock or modifying the part into a more versatile feature, the suggested name certainly throws up some red flags.

(Reuters) -Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday forecast $2 billion in sales in 2024 from a chip that aims to compete with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, helping shares recover after a quarterly outlook missed expectations.

 AMD forecast fourth-quarter revenue and gross margins below Wall Street estimates, hurt by a weak gaming market as well as a decline in demand from some industries for its programmable chips.

 The company said it expects $400 million in revenue from the chip in the fourth quarter, up from the $300 million forecast the company had given in August. Analysts said the recent expansion of U.S. sanctions on chip exports to Beijing will require AMD to seek licenses to sell its most high-end artificial intelligence chips to China, which it plans to launch and ramp only in the fourth quarter.

 Revenue at its data center business was roughly flat at $1.6 billion in the third quarter, while sales at its client segment, which caters to the PC market, rose 42% to $1.5 billion, signaling rebound in demand.

To our surprise, Nvidia still found a way to ship high-performance GPUs into China with their upcoming H20, L20, and L2 GPUs,” the chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis explained, breaking the news to the public. This means that Nvidia will not forgo China’s demand easily, so it decided to work on three newer chips to circumvent the US’ latest export ban.

He told employees that the company’s models were still early enough in development that OpenAI ought to commercialize and generate enough revenue to ensure that it could spend without limits on alignment and safety concerns; ChatGPT is reportedly on pace to generate more than $1 billion a year.

 Altman’s dismissal by OpenAI’s board on Friday was the culmination of a power struggle between the company’s two ideological extremes—one group born from Silicon Valley techno optimism, energized by rapid commercialization; the other steeped in fears that AI represents an existential risk to humanity and must be controlled with extreme caution. OpenAI would expand the alignment team’s research to develop more upstream AI-safety techniques with a dedicated 20 percent of the company’s existing computer chips, in preparation for the possibility of AGI arriving in this decade, the company said.

Matt While some deployment starts were down slightly from last quarter, a more important way to think about deployment starts and our revenue growth is that with 35 systems in progress at quarter end of this represents an over 100% increase from the 17 systems in progress a year ago and leaves us very well positioned strong revenue growth in the quarters ahead.

 And so we've made the conscious choice to grow as fast as we are to put as much innovation as we have out in the field as we have -- but very clearly, we spend a lot of our time as an executive team here at this company focused on exactly the point of your question, why do we have wasteful and inefficient and redundant costs at the gross margin line?

 Is that roughly the trajectory we should think about on a go-forward basis in terms of how you're able to add stack new system starts year-to-year?

 At a Glance
  A new software development method from the team that built Vicuna could greatly reduce inferencing time.
   LMSYS Org argues, however, that employing the Jacobi method can decode more than one token in several steps: “Consequently, very few iterations successfully achieve the simultaneous decoding and correct positioning of multiple tokens. Nvidia came out with a hardware-focused method with its new H200 chips , saying these will cut costs by half
  Now, the team behind the Vicuna AI model has come up with a software-based approach that starts during model development that it believes could greatly reduce inferencing costs and latency.
   By employing lookahead decoding, users can reduce the number of decoding steps, which allows the model to predict multiple tokens instead of a singular one each time. This defeats the fundamental goal of parallel decoding.”
  Instead, lookahead decoding surpasses the traditional method by creating a new token that is decoded based on its historical values from previous iterations.

While this seems to mark an inflection point for the company, it is still too early to be convinced that the deceleration the company had been seeing to its growth is over, and it remains to be seen how much of a real impact generative AI will have on its future growth.

While you can get a solid PC for $1,000 or less, through research you'll soon find that you can have a significantly better GPU like the RTX 4070 for a little more money. That's not a bad thing, but it makes it even more difficult for people who just want a good PC without having to do hours of homework. I finally built a new PC this year, and even though I was familiar with the detailed benchmarks of all newer GPUs, I still found myself going back and forth on this choice a lot.

  Sycamore said investors see crypto stocks as a way to gain crypto exposure until the United States approves spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

  CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng and de Wet agreed that crypto stocks are “exchange-listed proxies” for investors to indirectly expose themselves to the market. “As the price of Bitcoin rises, it fuels excitement and drives increased trading volumes and participation across the crypto ecosystem,” he added.
  Sycamore said Bitcoin is supported “by a set of tailwinds not seen since 2021” and highlighted the optimism around spot ETF approvals, possible U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts next year and the upcoming Bitcoin halving slated for April.

2023-12-08,"Alternative Perspectives  SPONSORED / OPINION — While the National Security community works to scale the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML), generative AI has emerged to offer a transformative step-change in capabilities.
   In addition to encouraging early adoption and experimentation, AWS offers several tools and services that uphold security and privacy best practices to help national security organizations adopt and scale generative AI to advance their missions.
  1) Test, select, privately customize, and deploy FMs into generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock . For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is establishing the U.S. AI Safety Institute and a related Consortium , Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Technology Officer Heidi Shyu is convening the Defense Science Board Task Force on Balancing Security, Reliability, and Technological Advantage in Generative AI for Defense , and Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. Kathleen Hicks has organized Task Force Lima to analyze and integrate generative AI tools across DoD.
  Amazon has invested heavily in the development and deployment of AI and ML for more than 25 years and Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been working with and serving the National Security community for 10 years. For instance, ML applications for synthetic aperture radar and earth observation imagery have been used for a wide range of agricultural, humanitarian, and national security use cases, as presented at AWS re:Invent 2020 and
  As systems and sensors continue to increase in number and complexity, the geospatial community is looking to integrate generative AI into AI and ML systems to “revolutionize GEOINT tradecraft by enabling analysts to answer questions that were previously unanswerable”. Building and training generative AI models from scratch is exceptionally resource intensive, sometimes on the order of $1B in compute, but there is an ever-growing market for proprietary and open source models that only need limited “fine tuning” or even simple prompting to cater to application needs.

artificial intelligence market, known as the Instinct MI300X APU (Accelerated Processing Unit). Furthermore, AMD anticipates that these new chips will enable the company to capture a significant portion of the $400 billion total addressable market for AI chips, currently dominated by Nvidia with about 90% market share.
   A second issue worth highlighting is Moore's presumption that most would-be buyers of AMD's AI chips seem to hope it will be a “cost effective” alternative to Nvidia chips for use in AI inference operations. What's more, given that the entire semiconductor market, globally, currently stands at just $600 billion, AMD's assertion of a “$400 billion” total addressable market in AI chips alone seems a bit aggressive.
   Moore also posited a $400 billion-a-year total addressable market for AI chips – a market that, as already stated, has been almost a wholly owned subsidiary of Nvidia to-date.

  But Wall Street's spotlight was on the inflation report, which showed U.S. consumers paid prices for gasoline, food and other living costs last month that were 3.1 percent higher overall than a year earlier. The Fed has already yanked its main interest rate from virtually zero early last year to more than 5.25 percent, its highest level since 2001. Following the inflation report, traders were betting on a nearly 42 percent chance that the Fed will cut rates by March, according to data from CME Group. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for action from the Fed, held steady at 4.71 percent.

Sam Altman-led OpenAI could ring in the new year 2024 with some good news – it is in early talks to raise new funds at a valuation of at least $100 billion.

 Why It Matters: OpenAI's skyrocketing valuations reflect the excitement around AI – post the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, the company has announced multiple upgrades with more advanced features, with the most recent being GPT-4 Turbo.

 What Happened: If it goes through, this will be at least a $10 billion increase in valuation for the Microsoft Corp.-backed MSFT AI startup from the previously reported $90 billion number, according to Bloomberg.

   ""40 Years Ago, Brenda Spencer Took Lives, Changed Lives in a Mass Shooting at a San Diego Elementary School."" She answered with the-now-infamous quote: ""I don't like Mondays.""

 China’s semiconductor sector weathered a tough year that saw an escalation of US tech sanctions that restricted its access to advanced chip making tools and artificial intelligence (AI) processors, although industry spirits were buoyed by a breakthrough from local tech champion Huawei Technologies.

 Six weeks after sanctions-hit Huawei staged a surprise comeback with a 5G smartphone based on a 7-nanometre (nm) processor manufactured by Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), Washington ratcheted up its China export controls to cover a slew of process gear needed for semiconductor wafer fabrication, including lithography, etching, deposition, implant and cleaning.

  Malaysians should by now be familiar with smart as the latest premium electric vehicle brand brought in via Proton's PRO-NET division and sold via Mercedes-Benz authorised dealer network Hap Seng.
   However, it is likely that smart #1 buyers today will be able to experience future updates Over-The-Air from this new company as they roll out. For legacy car makers, going in this new direction has many risks and the cost is high, so partnering up with a technology company like ECARX can quicken the process, reduce costs and result in a more unique brand experience over something taken off the shelf.

 In this paper, we propose CoMoSVC, a consistency model-based SVC method, which aims to achieve both high-quality generation and high-speed sampling. Experiments on a single NVIDIA GTX4090 GPU reveal that although CoMoSVC has a significantly faster inference speed than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion-based SVC system, it still achieves comparable or superior conversion performance based on both subjective and objective metrics. A diffusion-based teacher model is first specially designed for SVC, and a student model is further distilled under self-consistency properties to achieve one-step sampling. However, the iterative sampling process results in slow inference speed, and acceleration thus becomes crucial.",neutral,0.49,"Audio, inference, consistency, sampling, CoMoSVC, diffusion, speed, high, timbre, samples, GPU, NVIDIA, SVC, model",2024-01-05,490.97,0.0

2024-01-12,"Valve has been pretty consistent about its attitude toward curating the games on Steam: It doesn't wanna.
 Even Alex Jones, a guy banned by YouTube and Facebook, has a game on Steam, so it's no surprise that Valve's new generative AI policy avoids ethical judgments, sticking to the company's 2018 declaration that it “shouldn't be choosing for you what content you can or can't buy.”
   The more prescient observation might be that Steam's new AI policy—which gives the thumbs up to generative AI in games on Steam so long as its use is disclosed and doesn't break any laws—is really just an acknowledgement that generative AI is already everywhere, including on Steam. Even with their legal status in the air, generative AI tools have already been built into industry-standard applications like Photoshop, and when AI-generated imagery pops up in games and marketing material, even the company that produced the material is sometimes surprised by it. 
  Knowing is half the battle?
  Valve is being typical Valve by leaving it up to the law to decide what's acceptable on Steam, but it is making one direct demand that I'm happy to see: developers must disclose AI use in games submitted to Steam, and parts of that disclosure will be published on Steam store pages for all to see.

  “India has to build its own AI, and at Krutrim, we are fully committed towards building the country's first complete AI computing stack.” — Founder Bhavish Aggarwal
  As we reported a few weeks ago, Krutrim's platform is proficient in understanding and processing up to 22 Indian languages with the ability to write and speak in 10 languages. As the founder with a third unicorn under his belt said, “Krutrim's innovative AI solutions underscore the confidence investors have in our ability to drive meaningful change out of India for the world.”
  Now, as Krutrim prepares for its public debut next month, it's pertinent to see if the startup can challenge the dominance of OpenAI, Google and Meta in the GenAI space and put India on the global AI map. The big hope for Aggarwal is that Indian companies — startups and enterprises — would ditch the over-reliance on OpenAI's GPT tools and Meta's Llama to adopt Krutrim.
   In our outlook for generative AI in 2024, we predicted that Indian language models will be a critical pillar of ‘AI for India' as non-English internet users outnumber English language users in the country.

We train StyleGAN2-ADA with both sets and then, after validating the quality of generated images, we use trained GANs as one of the augmentations approaches in multi-class classification problems.

  Conclusion
  In this paper, to solve a series of problems in the retinal disease image classification model, a novel artificial-intelligence-based approach for automatic assessment of retinal disease images using multi-view deep-broad learning (MDBL-Net) is proposed. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based approach for the automatic assessment of retinal disease images called a multi-view deep-broad learning network (MDBL-Net), which absorbs the advantages of deep learning and broad learning. Experiments were conducted on two public datasets, UCSD and OCT2017, and results demonstrate that MDBL-Net achieves high accuracy even with limited training data (only 1%) and significantly reduces training time compared to traditional deep learning models. The details of MDBL-Net are shown in Algorithm 1

  GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations include risks associated with the duration and scope of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulting in volatile market conditions, a decline in the securities markets that adversely affect our assets under management, negative performance of our products, the failure to perform as required under our investment management agreements, and a general downturn in the economy that negatively impacts our operations. GAMI conducts its investment advisory business principally through two subsidiaries: Gabelli Funds, LLC (24 open-end funds, 14 closed-end funds, 5 actively managed semi-transparent ETFs, and a SICAV) and GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (approximately 1,400 institutional and private wealth separate accounts). Distribution costs were higher based on slightly higher expense reimbursements in open-end funds; and,
  The lower other operating expenses this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2022 are due to the absence of subadvisory performance fees for the merger arbitrage SICAV in 2023.

Dear readers,

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the cheapest stock out of the Magnificent 7 on a trailing 12-months as well as forward basis. Seeking Alpha

And EPS are expected to rise even faster with GOOGL's consensus growth of around 15% per year for the next three years as a result of (1) growing ad revenue in their legacy search and network business, (2) improving operating margins thanks to the many initiatives taken recently (more on this later), (3) rapid AI market growth driving cloud revenue much higher and (4) a reduced share count thanks to an aggressive share repurchase program.

 Currently, Google's cloud business accounts for only about 10% of total revenues but is very promising thanks to its high growth rate. Carbon Finance

2 - Good growth prospects

Ad revenue from Search and YouTube continues to account for the bulk of Google's revenue. Main Street Data

Notably, Google has also been actively working towards improving their margins by:

reducing their headcount last quarter and significantly slowing the pace of headcount growth in Q4 and forward,

optimizing their real estate footprints,

and improving efficiency through incorporating AI into their processes.
