 However, once it goes public, its price will be affected by a number of factors over which it has little or no control, including macroeconomic factors, industry trends, whether the company is part of an index, and how that index performs. Any lack of transparency or conflict of interest that affects investor confidence can trigger a stock crash, causing damage to your company's market value.

 A takeaway owner who challenged Tesla has ended up £12,000 poorer after losing a fierce legal fight.
   Tesla, owned by Elon Musk, applied to invalidate Mr Ali's trademark, arguing it would take unfair advantage of its reputation. Amanj Ali, the boss of Colorado's Chicken in Bury, registered the trademark ‘Tesla Chicken and Pizza' with plans to open a new shop. Then in November 2021, the IPO told Mr Ali someone else wanted the ‘Tesla' name too, which turned out to be the car company.
   After the UK's Intellectual Property Office (IPO) ruled in Tesla's favour, Mr Ali was slapped with a £4,000 fine as well as more than £8,000 in legal costs.

   “Allowing EV owners to have a public charging experience similar to what they're used to with traditional fueling is certainly beneficial to increasing EV acceptance,” AutoPacific president Ed Kim said in a statement provided to Green Car Reports.
   Respondents pointed to gas-station features like windshield cleaner, air pumps for inflating tires, and vacuums as most-wanted features for charging stations, along with more charging-specific elements like clear signage for pricing and charging speed.

 Elon Musk is looking to move the legal home of SpaceX to Texas from Delaware after a judge in that state voided the billionaire's $55.8 billion Tesla pay package.
   Last month Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick invalidated the pay package that Tesla established for Musk in 2018, ruling that the process was “flawed” and the price “unfair.” McCormick's ruling came five years after shareholders filed a lawsuit accusing Musk and Tesla directors of breaching their duties and arguing that the pay package was a product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him.
   The change by SpaceX comes just days after Musk's brain implant company Neuralink moved its legal corporate home from Delaware to Nevada.

 Last month, chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota Akio Toyoda doubled down on his bearish stance against battery-powered EVs, arguing that hybrid EVs and hydrogen-powered cars will make up the lion's share of the market.

 Richter Fail

After racing to meet surging demand for EVs just six months ago, carmakers are now slamming the brakes and significantly cutting their plants' output.

 But while US automakers are expecting gloomier days ahead, the global EV market is far from slowing down, with consultant Rho Motion finding that a record number of EVs were sold globally in January, up 69 percent over last January.

Since I wrote about the electric vehicle [EV] giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) last November, its share price is down by ~19% and even more year-to-date [YTD] (see chart below). With price wars underway, and China's BYD company taking Tesla's spot in the number of vehicles delivered in 2023, its market multiples still look stretched, though. In its biggest Nordic market, Norway, Tesla's share jumped to 20% in 2023 from 12.2% the year before. In a hypothetical extreme case, if Tesla were to exit the Nordic markets, it could almost halve its quarterly YoY growth based on Q4 2023 figures.

 No surprises there, given that a slew of factors were working against during at that time.

  The Countryman continues to use the same multi-powertrain BMW Group UKL2 platform as the closely related BMW X1 and BMW X2 , and it's now being built beside those crossovers at BMW's Leipzig plant, rather than in the Netherlands as previously. It has an official WLTP fuel economy of 34.0mpg (along with CO2 emissions of 188g/km), compared with 38.2mpg for the S All4 and 40.9mpg for the entry-level C.
  So far, we've driven the JCW only in Portugal, and our test route wasn't long enough to assess how accurate that figure is.

  The Countryman JCW makes much play of its sporting ambitions, but don't expect a full-on driver's car.
   The challenge in creating a modern Mini is designing something that looks modern but also clearly evokes the 1959 original – and that challenge is heightened when the car in question is a chunky SUV.

 Bezos and Musk’s argument was rejected by the Supreme Court 86 years ago in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.

In that case, the NLRB found that the giant steel corporation Jones & Laughlin had violated the National Labor Relations Act by firing workers for trying to organize a union. But modern-day robber barons Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk want the Supreme Court to reverse its 1937 ruling and return America to a time before workers had the right to form unions. Jeff Bezos’s view (I’m assuming Amazon’s filing reflects his view) is the same as that of retrograde Elon Musk, whose SpaceX made an almost identical argument in a lawsuit last month.

 The NLRB is the agency that enforces the National Labor Relations Act—the 1935 Act that legitimized labor unions.

All earnings call transcripts Moving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which is the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to an estimated 4% non-GAAP operating income rate for fiscal '24 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20. These actions will allow us to do the following: balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop; redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy; and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago, whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits. And it's why I also believe, this year, our focus is more on touching as many stores as we can and making sure that that shopping experience feels good; carefully thinking about what the right portfolio looks like over the longer period, and I think Matt and the team have done a really nice job continuing to make sure we are in the right places at the right times; and then testing our way into what we think the right footprint in the future is because it's just not as easy as is it stores or is it online.

In that regard, Ford has long performed quite well, however, ranking among the top leased brands in Q1 Q2 , and Q3 of 2023, in fact.
