  Last year, Google agreed to pay $391.5 million to resolve similar allegations
   California:
  Google agreed to pay $155 million to settle claims by California and private plaintiffs that the search engine company misled consumers about how it tracks their locations, and used their data without consent. ""That's unacceptable.""
  The California settlement requires Google to pay $93 million, and disclose more about how it tracks people's whereabouts and uses data it collects.
   Money from Google's $62 million settlement with private plaintiffs would, after deducting legal fees, go to court-approved nonprofit groups that track internet privacy concerns.
   Both settlements resolve claims that the Alphabet Inc unit deceived people into believing they maintained control over how Google collected and used their personal data.

Since 2005, Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on its Safari web browser, a deal that's brought the two trillion-dollar corporations together in ways that have raised eyebrows in Washington. First forged 18 years ago, it made Google Apple's default search engine, while giving Apple as much as a 50% share of the ad revenue Google made from searches by users of Apple's Safari browser. That message is part of a trove of potentially damning internal communications coming to light as part of the US Department of Justice's antitrust case against Alphabet Inc.'s Google, where the government accuses the search giant of freezing out competitors through deals like the one it has with Apple.

One of the newest parliamentary secretaries appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could find himself very busy divesting from dozens of stocks.

 Under Part II of the Conflict of Interest Act, public office holders including parliamentary secretaries must: Recuse from discussions, debates or votes where they would be in a conflict of interest; file confidential disclosure reports detailing assets, liabilities, income and gifts received; file public declarations detailing certain kinds of assets, liabilities and gifts received; and divest certain kinds of assets – such as publicly traded shares – by selling them at arm’s length or putting them in a blind trust.

 Among Noormohamed’s 67 public company holdings, reported last month to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, are big tech and media companies that fall under the regulation of Canadian Heritage, including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Comcast Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Netflix Inc. and Telus Corp.

 Vancouver Granville Liberal MP Taleeb Noormohamed was named parliamentary secretary to Canadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge on Friday.

Microsoft Corp. discussed selling its Bing search engine to Apple Inc. around 2020, a deal that would have replaced Google as the default option on the iPhone maker’s devices, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

 Executives from Microsoft met with Apple’s services chief, Eddy Cue, who brokered the current search engine relationship with Alphabet Inc.’s Google, to discuss the possibility of acquiring Bing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation was confidential. In court on Thursday, Microsoft business development executive Jon Tinter said that his company weighed making a multibillion-dollar investment in its relationship with Apple in 2016, an effort to outspend Google and make Bing the default option on Apple devices. The agreement covers the Safari web browser for the iPhone, iPad and Mac, and the Cupertino, California-based company gets a percentage of the revenue that Google makes from searches in the Apple browser.

 In testimony earlier this week, Apple’s Cue pushed back on that assertion, saying his company uses Google because it’s the best search option available.

   In its questioning, the Justice Department showed an August 2020 email by Samsung executive David Eun, who complained that ""Google is clearly buying its way to squelch competitors.""

  SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's telecommunications regulator said on Friday that Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple have abused their dominant app market position and warned of possible fines totalling up to $50.5 million.
   The KCC said that Google and Apple's enforcement of certain payment methods, and Apple's ""discriminatory charging of fees to domestic app developers"" is likely to undermine the law's purpose of promoting fair competition.
   The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement that the two tech giants forced app developers into specific payment methods and caused unfair delay in app review.
   After hearing from the companies, the regulator could decide to impose fines of up to 68 billion won ($50.47 million), including 47.5 billion won for Google and 20.5 billion won for Apple, KCC said.

2023-10-12,"WASHINGTON — Internet companies Google, Amazon and Cloudflare say they have weathered the internet's largest-known denial of service attack and are sounding the alarm over a new technique they warn could easily cause widespread disruption.

 Cloudflare said the attack was of a magnitude that ""has never been seen before"".

All three companies said the supersized attacks were enabled by a weakness in HTTP/2 — a newer version of the HTTP network protocol that underpins the World Wide Web — that makes servers particularly vulnerable to rogue requests.

 Alphabet Inc-owned Google said in a blog post published Tuesday (Oct 10) that its cloud services had parried an avalanche of rogue traffic more than seven times the size of the previous record-breaking attack thwarted last year.

 Denial of service is among the web's most basic form of attack and it works by simply overwhelming targeted servers with a firehose of bogus requests for data, making it impossible for legitimate web traffic to get through.

 The recent attacks measured by Google, Cloudflare and Amazon were capable of generating hundreds of millions of request per second.

Google’s Flood Hub

Alphabet’s Google is setting itself up to be a one-stop shop for all sorts of climate- and sustainability-related decisions. With Project Green Light, a tool for traffic engineers, Google aims to make stop lights more efficient, resulting in fewer stops and thus lower emissions from cars. Like Google’s tree-mapping tool, Cool Roofs uses AI and aerial photos to provide better insights about reflective rooftops. Mitigating heat with tree maps

A less vital but still practical update is the expansion of the Tree Canopy tool, which combines AI and aerial images to show the parts of a city that have decent tree coverage—and therefore better shade and cooler ambient temperatures. The tool is available on Google Search and Maps in fire-prone parts of Canada, the U.S., and Australia.

Apple plans to approach generative AI “responsibly,” according to Cook, and fans of the company’s devices “will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them.”

 Cook’s responses Thursday echoed commentary from Apple’s prior earnings call, during which he told an analyst curious about the company’s AI efforts that Apple tends “to announce things as they come to market.” ““I’m not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we really don’t do that.”” — Apple CEO Tim Cook

Cook’s comments came in response to a question from an analyst, who wondered if the company would look to monetize its coming Vision Pro headset or other initiatives using generative AI, as other companies step up their own experimentations.

2023-11-04,"What Is Capital Employed?

Capital employed, also known as funds employed, is the total amount of capital used for the acquisition of profits by a firm or project. Some analysts prefer return on capital employed over return on equity and return on assets since it takes long-term financing into consideration, and is a better gauge for the performance or profitability of the company over a longer period of time.

 Capital employed = Total assets − Current liabilities \begin{aligned} \text{Capital employed} &= \text{Total assets} - \text{Current liabilities} \\ &=\text{Equity} + \text{Noncurrent liabilities} \end{aligned} Capital employed​=Total assets−Current liabilities​﻿

Capital employed is calculated by taking total assets from the balance sheet and subtracting current liabilities, which are short-term financial obligations.

 Capital employed can be calculated by adding fixed assets to working capital, or by adding equity—found in shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet—to non-current liabilities, meaning long-term liabilities. Capital employed is helpful since it's used with other financial metrics to determine the return on a company's assets as well as how effective management is at employing capital.

the default on the company's mobile devices, according to testimony presented by Epic Games Inc.
  James Kolotouros, Vice President for Partnerships at Google, testified Monday under questioning by an Epic lawyer in the San Francisco trial that Google devised plans to share app store revenue with Android mobile device makers to ensure their products were preinstalled with Google Play on home screens.
   The first slide said: “Existential Question — How do we continue to keep Play as the preeminent distribution platform for Android?”
  In 2019, Google offered to pay Samsung $200 million over four years so that Samsung's Galaxy Store app marketplace would be available within the Google Play store rather than preinstalled and the South Korean device maker would not offer its own payment or billing system. Internal Emails
  Epic's lawyer questioned Kolotouros about internal emails that showed Google employees were concerned that Google Play revenue was at risk as Android phone manufacturers began launching their own app stores and payment systems. Epic is seeking to show that executives at the Alphabet Inc. unit were eager to discourage the proliferation of third-party app stores that would cut into Google Play's operating profit — which was estimated by Epic earlier in the trial at more than $12 billion in 2021, from sales that include the standard 30% revenue cut the company took from app developers.

2023-11-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney testified that Google’s Android operating system is a “fake open platform” in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit over claims that the technology giant thwarts app market competition.

 Most Read from Bloomberg

Sweeney, who founded the company that makes the blockbuster Fortnite, took the witness stand Monday in San Francisco federal court to reinforce his claims that Google Play policies are unlawful and allow Alphabet Inc. to maintain a monopoly in the Android mobile-app distribution market.

 When asked by Epic’s lawyer what he hopes the jury will decide, he said: “We want the jury to find that Google has violated the law so the court can make Google stop enforcing these policies.”

Cross-Examination

On cross-examination, Google’s lawyer Jonathan Kravis questioned Sweeney to underpin the technology company’s argument that the 30% cut is the standard fee charged to developers by gaming platforms. “Android is the only major mobile platform that gives developers multiple ways to distribute apps.”

Spotify’s Deal

Earlier in the day, Don Harrison, who heads global partnerships at Google, revealed that his company had an agreement with Spotify that gave the music streaming service a generous break on developer fees: Spotify pays 0% if users opt to use the music platform’s payment system and 4% if users go with the Google Play billing system to process transactions.",neutral,0.71,"North Carolina, PlayStation, monopoly, cross-examination, China, Oakland, Bloomberg L.P., rein, jury trial, Read, Bloomberg

  The online news law, which was modeled after a similar law in Australia, had faced a backlash from tech companies, including Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and in August started blocking news content from the feeds of Canadian users.
   Canadian media companies are caught in the middle of a standoff between Silicon Valley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, with their audiences unable to access news on some of the world's most popular social media platforms. At the same time, the Government of Canada continues to take concrete steps to fight hate crime and hate speech, in all their forms.”
  McLeod said that Department of Canadian Heritage is “also leading efforts to improve online safety.”
  What users can do
  There are things that users can do if hateful content persists, and quitting the platforms altogether isn't a realistic option, said Aimée Morrison, an associate professor at The University of Waterloo's English department whose work focuses on social media. Canada's standoff with the technology giants Google and Meta over their use of domestic news content eased on one front, as the federal government announced Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Google to compensate publishers in Canada.

 Asked about those claims, FDA spokesperson Kahn said the agency's “collaboration with India highlights continued advancement of the production and availability of medical products that both countries and the entire world rely upon.”
  By 2019, India's manufacturing clout had grown to the point that the country had more FDA-registered generic drug facilities than the US, according to a Bloomberg analysis of agency data. The Pentagon in August chose an independent lab with which the FDA has publicly feuded, Valisure LLC, to test some of the generics available to millions of military personnel and their families, two years after Kaiser Permanente, a health system serving 12.7 million in the US, started a similar program with the lab. The office primarily focuses on building relationships in government and industry rather than compliance.
  Just before the pandemic, Valisure, a tiny lab in New Haven, Connecticut, started gaining customers – and embarrassing the FDA – by doing something people expect the regulator already does: test drugs.

 Speaking at a seminar on ‘Careers in Management, Sciences and Technology’, organised by The Hindu FIC, in collaboration with SRM University-AP on December 8 (Friday), at PB Siddhartha College of Arts and Sciences, Dr. Jayaseelan said it was never too late to think big and urged students to widen their horizons, look beyond their normal limits and see things in a larger picture.

Google’s mobile app store maintains a monopoly in the Android app distribution and payments market, a federal jury in California decided, dealing a blow to the technology giant in a high-stakes antitrust battle with Epic Games Inc.



Google Play willfully wields monopoly power through Alphabet Inc. unit Google’s anticompetitive conduct, jurors found Monday after deliberating for less than four hours following a nearly monthlong trial in San Francisco. Epic sued Google three years ago, claiming the tech company monopolized the Android app distribution market for more than a decade by striking side deals with rivals and using its resources to thwart competition.

 US District Judge James Donato, who oversaw the trial, will decide whether Google must open the door for payment and app distribution methods outside its own app store following the verdict that Google Play policies are unlawful.

 Epic, known for its popular Fortnite game, was the only stakeholder to challenge Alphabet at trial after the Mountain View, California-based company recently reached settlements with consumers, state attorneys general and Match Group Inc., all of whom had targeted Google Play policies in complaints. In its defense, Google contended that its partnerships help phones that run on the Android operating system better compete against smartphone market rival Apple Inc.’s iPhone.

investors' concerns that the software maker's expansion into a competitive market isn't panning out as expected.
   Oracle's fiscal second-quarter sales increased 5% to $12.9 billion, the company said Monday, falling below analysts' expectations of $13.1 billion. Management said in September that the company is working to shift Cerner's legacy software business to the cloud, which means it must change the structure of contracts with many customers. Cloud sales, excluding revenue from the Cerner health unit, will gain about 27%, she said, which would be an acceleration from the fiscal second quarter. That initiative to rent out computing power and storage over the internet hit a snag in September when Oracle reported its first infrastructure growth slowdown after more than a year of acceleration.

2023-12-14,"Apple Inc. is set to be hit by a ban on its App Store rules that govern music-streaming rivals and a potential hefty fine in the European Union’s latest attempt to limit the power of Big Tech.

 EU regulators are putting the finishing touches to a decision that would prohibit Apple’s practice of blocking music services from pushing their users away from the App Store to alternative subscription options, according to people familiar with the investigation.

 The probe was sparked by a complaint nearly four years ago from Sweden’s Spotify Technology SA, which claimed it was forced to ramp up the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs associated with Apple’s alleged stranglehold on how the App Store operates.

 This week, jurors found that Google unfairly wields monopoly power, in a win for Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc., which has also complained about Apple’s App Store policies.

 The EU crackdown on App Store rules has run alongside another probe focused on how Cupertino, California-based Apple controls tap-to-pay technology on its devices.

  Witherspoon made the remarks during an interview for the latest episode of the Bloomberg Originals series AI IRL, available to stream now.
   Though the net effect of AI's impact on carbon emissions is still in question, Witherspoon said there are other ways AI can be used to help address climate issues.

However, Champion has taken the lead by raising his price target for Amazon's stock to $185, an increase from the previous $170 target.

2023-12-25,"OpenAI reportedly discussing new funding round that would raise its value to over $100B
 Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup OpenAI , the creator of ChatGPT, is said to be holding discussions with investors over a fresh round of funding that would value it at or above $100 billion. It's said that a number of prominent venture capital firms, including some of OpenAI's earliest investors and also Microsoft, are interested in backing Altman's chip venture.
   That came after the startup released its ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, kicking off a craze around generative AI.
  ChatGPT, which is able to generate humanlike responses to almost any kind of prompt, has fueled a meteoric rise in OpenAI's value. OpenAI isn't the only AI startup that has attracted millions of dollars in funding. Elsewhere, OpenAI is said to be close to completing a separate tender offer led by Thrive Capital, which would allow its employees to sell their shares at a valuation of around $86 billion, Bloomberg's report said.

of funding that could potentially value the company at or above an impressive $100 billion.
   As OpenAI continues to push the boundaries of AI technology with ChatGPT and explores ventures like the Tigris project, securing substantial funding would undoubtedly enhance its capabilities and influence in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The coming months will likely witness further developments in OpenAI's funding endeavors, shaping the trajectory of the company and its impact on the future of AI.
   In a strategic move in October, G42, a technology company, announced a partnership with OpenAI to deliver advanced AI solutions to the UAE and regional markets.

Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon
  By Nate Raymond
  (Reuters) – Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former fixer and lawyer, said in court papers unsealed on Friday that he mistakenly gave his attorney fake case citations generated by an artificial intelligence program that made their way into an official court filing.
   Cohen, who was disbarred nearly five years ago, in Friday's filings said those citations came from his own online research and that he had not expected Schwartz to “drop the cases wholesale into his submission without even confirming they existed.”
  Cohen said he had “not kept up with emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.”
  “I deeply regret any problems Mr. Schwartz's filing may have caused,” Cohen said in the filing.
   Cohen, who is expected to be a star witness against Trump at one of the former president's criminal trials, said in a sworn declaration in federal court in Manhattan that he did not realize the citations generated by Google Bard were fictitious.
   Cohen was recently a key witness in New York state Attorney General Letitia James' civil fraud case against Trump.

 Alphabet's Google, which owns YouTube, has consistently denied being their boss, even after NLRB officials last year deemed it a “joint employer” of the workers – a company with enough control over them to be liable for their treatment and obligated to negotiate with them if they unionize.
   Another group of Alphabet contract staff, who are employed via Accenture Plc to work on content for Google's support pages, voted to unionize with the Alphabet Workers Union in November; Alphabet is appealing an NLRB regional director's determination that it is a joint employer of those workers as well.
   Contract staff became the majority of the company's global workforce in 2018, and the Alphabet Workers Union, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America, has been pushing to organize both those workers and Alphabet's direct employees since it launched in 2021.
   “Any future appeals by Alphabet are just an attempt to avoid collectively bargaining with the union and pad the pockets of shareholders and executives,” YouTube Music worker Katie-Marie Marschner said in an emailed statement from the union.

  iPhone Sales Stutter: Apple's year-over-year sales decline is likely to extend to five quarters, with the company likely reporting another quarter of revenue decline, said Gurman in the report. “Apple is way behind in AI and it's a major risk for a company that considers itself the top innovator in consumer technology,” the columnist said, adding “Samsung will do everything it can to highlight that deficiency to the market over the next several months.”
  Regulatory Threat: The App Store will also face increasing regulatory challenges, particularly as a result of the Digital Markets Act in the European Union, Gurman said. Apple CFO Luca Maestri's comments on the September quarter earnings call suggest iPhone sales during the holiday quarter will likely be only marginally stronger than a year ago, Gurman said, adding that the muted expectation is despite the iPhone 14 Pro sales getting hit by COVID-19 supply disruptions a year ago.

Saudi Arabia announced the new rules for state contracts in February 2021, saying it wanted to limit ‘economic leakage' — a term used by the government for state spending that can benefit firms that don't have a substantial presence in the country. Under the Saudi rules, firms can be granted a special HQ license if they set up a center in Riyadh that meets various criteria, including a minimum of 15 staff and two other countries reporting to it.

Google earlier said it was eliminating a few hundred roles across engineering, hardware and the Assistant teams, though most of the impact hit the company's augmented reality hardware division. “We won't stop fighting until our jobs are safe!”

Days after sharing the reason why he continues to upload videos on Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG (GOOGL) YouTube and not Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), content creator Jimmy Donaldson, popularly known as MrBeast has re-uploaded a video directly on the tech billionaire’s platform as a testing subject. Musk was quick to spot MrBeast’s post and shared it on the platform, saying, “First MrBeast video posted directly on 𝕏!”

Last month, when responding to why he uploads videos on YouTube and not X, MrBeast had said, “My videos cost millions to make and even if they got a billion views on X it wouldn’t fund a fraction of it. on the microblogging site, saying that he is curious about “how much ad revenue a video on X would make.”

The YouTuber informed his 25.3 million followers on the platform that he would share the ad revenue the next week.

 What Happened: On the weekend, MrBeast took to X and posted his video titled “$1 Car vs $100,000,000 Car!!!” The same video posted by the YouTuber on Alphabet’s online video sharing and social media platform almost three months ago has received over 211 million views.

2024-01-23,"Artificial intelligence can't replace the majority of jobs right now in cost-effective ways, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found in a study that sought to address fears about AI replacing humans in a swath of industries.
  In one of the first in-depth probes of the viability of AI displacing labor, researchers modeled the cost attractiveness of automating various tasks in the US, concentrating on jobs where computer vision was employed — for instance, teachers and property appraisers. “We find that only 23% of worker compensation ‘exposed' to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.”
  Computer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to derive meaningful information from digital images and other visual inputs, with its most ubiquitous applications showing up in object detection systems for autonomous driving or in helping categorize photos on smartphones.
   Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models,” the researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page paper titled Beyond AI Exposure.

   The results announced Tuesday by Alphabet Inc. marked the third consecutive quarter of escalating revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company, with most of the sales coming through Google's dominance of search and online advertising. Google's corporate parent returned to double-digit revenue growth during last year's final quarter, signaling the internet powerhouse has regained its footing even as it grapples with regulatory and competitive threats to its digital empire.

   ""We are sticking with our call for a first cut in June, but after Powell's remarks it's not hard to see a configuration of employment and inflation data that gets the Committee cutting by May.""
  Indeed, markets actually doubled down on a May move, pricing in 32 basis points (bps) of cuts - implying a 100% probability of 25bps and some chance of a 50bps easing.

  Investors also seemed to be wagering that more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.
   The Federal Reserve committee's decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.

Microsoft recently overtook Apple again in the market-cap ranks

Earnings season is causing a reshuffling among the ranks of the largest U.S. companies.

 Amazon edged out Alphabet only barely, with a closing market cap of $1.785 trillion compared with $1.777 trillion for Alphabet, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

 While the two traded around the top spot in January, Microsoft has been sitting there since Jan. 25.

Don't miss: Microsoft earnings may have offered a big bullish clue about cloud growth

Microsoft also rests alone in the $3 trillion club, with Apple, the only other U.S. company to ever claim membership, having fallen out of it.

 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) overtook Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) and become the third-largest U.S. public company upon Friday's close, after its results were well received by Wall Street and Alphabet's earlier in the week got panned.

 That was also the last time Amazon was the third-largest by market cap.

   At the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year, interest rates remained unchanged as anticipated, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell dismissing the possibility of a rate reduction in March.

2024-02-10,"When Shopify Inc. SHOP-T reports its quarterly financial results next week, there may be a lot of nervous investors looking for indications that the e-commerce company is performing as well as its share price.

 While Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet have been cruising to record highs this year, Shopify’s share price is 45 per cent below its highs in 2021, when the promise of e-commerce was all the rage and the company was more valuable than Royal Bank of Canada.

 And over the past year, Shopify’s share price is up 81 per cent, behind Nvidia and Meta Platforms but ahead of Amazon.com Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc.

But is Shopify truly magnificent?

 And, just as the Magnificent Seven are leading major U.S. benchmarks over the past year, Shopify is second only to Celestica Inc. – another company benefiting from surging interest in the potential for AI – among members of the S&P/TSX Composite Index over the same one-year period.

 That leads to one other quality that Shopify has in common with the Magnificent Seven: The elevated stock price is reflecting lofty expectations among investors.

The S&P 500 Index finished above 5,000 for the first time ever Friday as investors continue to bet on the resilient U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s plans to start cutting interest rates later this year.
  Earnings for the seven biggest growth companies in the S&P 500 are on course to rise by more than 20% in 2024, double the combined gain of S&P 500 companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The Magnificent Seven are projected to post combined profit growth of about 55% in the fourth quarter, dwarfing the S&P 500’s expected expansion of 1.2%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. This helps explain why the S&P 500’s tech sector is trading at a 33% premium to the index on a forward price-to-earnings basis, per data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
  Leadership remains in tech since AI will contribute to productivity and earnings growth for companies.”
