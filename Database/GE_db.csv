  “The training segments and sub-segments can be easily selected by users much like YouTube, with content seamlessly configured for delivery on terminals, hand-held devices, or within learning management systems.”
  CNSE plans to use DeepHow's AI-powered platform to expand curriculum content available through the established Career Alignment Platform (CAP) application. “DeepHow enables rapid, efficient and low-cost production of training videos that utilize AI to automatically disaggregate the sequence of instructional procedures to easily modify the flow, such as reordering sequence of steps, content and delivery within an existing video recorded in the actual work environment,” said Michael Fancher, senior research associate at CNSE and director of the NYS Center for Advanced Technology in Nanoelectronics. “This partnership with UAlbany will not only advance the development of training tools specifically serving on-the-Job training in semiconductor, but also continue the DeepHow's five-year track record of advancing AI applications in the skilled workforce industry,” said DeepHow co-founder and CEO Sam Zheng.
   The team is planning additional steps to advance the use of DeepHow's AI-assisted video training application in the semiconductor industry and energy efficient building operations.
