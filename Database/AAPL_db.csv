2023-09-18,"Joe Biden's arrival in New York City caused traffic chaos on Sunday night as he took his family for dinner at a swanky Italian restaurant where Alec Baldwin is a regular.

 The president traveled via Air Force One from the White House to New York on Sunday evening, causing a major traffic pile-up as his motorcade made its way from JFK to the city center

However, after enjoying the family affair, Biden might be keen to avoid his City Hall counterparts next week as they continue to fire criticism at him at every opportunity over the handling of the migrant crisis. New York City is struggling to cope with overwhelming numbers of migrants arriving each month and many have been left to sleep on the streets as they await processing

As 10,000 refugees continue to pour into the city each month, Mayor Eric Adams (pictured) warned the problem is now threatening to 'destroy' New York City

Protesters in New York gather ahead of the UN General Assembly, set to open in the city on September 19, 2023

Department of Homeland Security employees have blasted the mayor's office for having 'no exit strategy' for the 10,000 refugees the city takes in each month

This has sparked private grumbling from developing-country diplomats that key global players won´t be listening to their demands, which need billions of dollars to implement.

 Joe Biden has arrived in New York City ahead of the UN Assembly amid a growing cacophony of criticism over his handling of the Big Apple's migrant crisis

 Later on Sunday, the streets of New York City were blocked again, this time by traffic gridlock as central highways were shut for the president's motorcade to pass through.

2023-09-22,"Fenwick & West is asking a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the law firm helped enable a massive fraud allegedly committed by its client, the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
  The motion to dismiss, filed by Fenwick's lawyers with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, constituted the firm's first public defense of its actions in connection with FTX and co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The motion also attacked the plaintiffs' claim that Fenwick needs to be held liable because Bankman-Fried used “routine” and lawful legal services the firm provided to him to further his alleged fraudulent schemes.
   Fenwick's alleged services can be reduced to “three basic acts,” the Gibson Dunn team, led by partner Kevin Rosen, argued—employing lawyers that eventually left Fenwick to join FTX; forming corporations that Bankman-Fried used to perpetrate fraud; and advising FTX on regulatory compliance as it pertained to crypto trading.
   Fenwick has asked a federal judge to toss a lawsuit alleging it played a role in FTX's fraud, saying its work for the crypto exchange amounted to “routine” legal services.

2023-09-24,"NEW YORK – Chip start-up Rivos is counter-suing Apple Inc., claiming the tech giant forces employees to sign restrictive agreements that prevent them from working elsewhere and stifle up-and-coming companies that hire its staff.

 The countersuit filed on Friday by Rivos and six former Apple employees in a San Jose federal court escalates an acrimonious trade secret feud that began when Apple last year sued Rivos and former employees who joined the start-up.

 The agreement includes, a non-solicitation provision, “which is designed to, and Apple uses to, chill employee mobility and competition,” Rivos said in its countersuit.

 Rivos claims Apple’s Intellectual Property Agreement that Apple employees sign as condition of employment are “expansive as to cover anything ‘learned’ during the course of employment, regardless whether it is a trade secret”. “Afraid of any threat of legitimate competition in the marketplace, and hoping to frighten and send a message to any employees who might dare to leave Apple to work somewhere else, Apple has resorted to trying to thwart emerging startups through anticompetitive measures, including illegally restricting employee mobility,” Rivos said in its countersuit.

It was also the time when a bizarre TV3 marketing campaign took hold of the country, and some tiny dots took over our television screens. It's unclear what specific information (if any) TV3 gleaned from the dots, but an AdMedia news article from November 2000 quotes the CEO of the Tellydots promotion company as saying 10% of Tellydots were expected to be returned.

Kansas City Chiefs took on the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium outside the Big Apple.
   Swift sparked a fan frenzy -- among NFL watchers and her own legion of ""Swifties"" -- when she attended the Chiefs' home game against the Chicago Bears last weekend, sitting in a luxury box alongside Kelce's mother, Donna.
   After a report Tuesday citing merchandise company Fanatics that his jersey sales had climbed more than 400 percent, Kelce said: ""Sounds like the Swifties are also part of Chiefs Kingdom.""
  The NFL, no strangers to celebrity spectacle, were quick to the buzz brought by Swift, posting plenty of pictures of Swift and friends as they enjoyed the Chiefs-Jets Game, which occupied the coveted ""Sunday Night Football"" slot.
   InStyle reported Swift had been seen dining in New York with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the night before the game.
   ""
  Fans posting on social media platform X were poking fun at NBC early in the game for the numerous shots of Swift and friends watching the game.

  Aydah's father, Nikolas DiMaso, has been charged with Capital Murder and Conspiracy to Commit Aggravated Child Abuse while his girlfriend, Haley Dee Metz, was charged with Aggravated Assault and Conspiracy to Commit Aggravated Assault. “Cause all these agencies touched and were warned that this poor child was suffering and she needed to get out of that house and out of that situation and they failed her completely and as a result, this tragedy occurred,” said Attorney Tommy James.

Let’s start with the Pixel 8: the phone is smaller than last year’s model, with the screen shrinking to just 6.2-inches, though the actual screen quality has improved, with Google providing the diminutive phone with a better OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ capabilities, insane brightness (with peak brightness hitting 2000 nits) as well as Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection. And just like Google’s other Pixel devices, the new crop of phones is guaranteed to get OS updates far longer than what other manufacturers offer. There’s wireless charging on tap though that maxes out at 18W.
 The Pixel 8 Pro meanwhile has a bigger 6.7-inch LTPO OLED panel that’s somehow even brighter than the Pixel 8, with its peak brightness coming in at a eye-melting 2400 nits. Unfortunately, just like the devices before it, the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will likely not arrive in the Philippines, which is a shame since there are a lot of cool features on tap here.

Video calls on Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms are a standard part of life for many people now, and while built-in cameras on laptops and desktops are getting better, they still can't hold a candle to external webcams that have higher resolutions, better autofocus and extra features like light correction and more. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use.

One of the strangest parts of Global Offensive was Valve’s push to get it on as many platforms as possible. Based on these statements, it is unlikely that Valve will ever release support for CS2 on Mac. Valve has finally issued a statement on CS2 for Mac, and the news isn’t good.
  Mac players can get a refund for Prime in CS2

  Payton Pritchard continues to rule the preseason, putting up 17 points for Boston, with Svi Mykhailiuk (15 points, 6 rebounds) and Neemias Queta (10 points, 2 assists) representing the bench mob well with limited run.
   Sam Hauser (15 points, 3 assists) also shined on the starting unit, with likely usual starters Kristaps Porzingis Jrue Holiday , and Derrick White all scoring exactly 11 points apiece in 17 minutes of game time for all three.

 In line with the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP), the Poli Digital agenda will focus on the importance of digitalisation in polytechnic education including for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). Polytechnic students and lecturers will also be given exposure to Apple technologies via the Apple Edu Classroom where they will be able to learn and use Apple software and devices in their learning environment.

 Has there ever been a fruit as celebrated as the apple ? At the time, one farmer told the New York Times that they had no one to blame but themselves: “For almost 50 years, we've been cramming down the consumer's throat a red apple with ever thicker skin, sometimes mushy, sometimes very good if done right, but a product that was bred for color and size and not for taste.”

  The return of the heritage apple
  Nowadays, with the Red Delicious in the rearview mirror for many consumers, orchards large and small have begun to focus on growing other varieties, especially those heritage cultivars that were once deemed too imperfect for market. “Sometimes those branches would produce a redder apple than the rest of the tree.”
  Benscoter, who is 68, remembers that once upon a time in Washington state, Red Delicious was in fact delicious—but those redder varieties always won out. Bunker is one of a handful of lay apple historians who have charted the rise and decline of the fruit across North America, seeking out cultivars thought to be extinct and documenting its myriad genetic manifestations throughout the past several centuries.
   Wherever they settled, Bunker says, arriving colonists sewed the seeds of “keepers” that had survived their long transatlantic voyages, leading to an explosive proliferation of apple varieties across North America.",neutral,0.8,"New England, Atlantic, tree, Tian Shan, Eastern Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Philly Fluff, heterozygotes, pomological, Apples, Hubbardston Nonesuch, Delicious, Hubbardston, Congress, James Fitz, Wherever, varieties, Minnesota, heirloom, funnel, South, King Solomon, Food Styling, America, Benscoter, Norse, crab apple, Wired, Apple History, Malus sylvestris, Nonesuch, stone fruit, Malus, CSA, U, Ohio Valley, Midwest, Temperance Movement, Nowadays, Lee Calhoun, FBI, Emily Dickinson, Goddesses, Tennessee, Honeycrisp, Kazakh, cultivars, Red Delicious, Spain, Originally Appeared, graft, hybrid species, Esopus, supermarket, BCE, East Coast, squirrel, soup, Dan Bussey—a, Middle East, French, Bunker, Central Asia, grafting, Micah, Civil War, apples, Kazakhstan, fruit, apple, Basques, species, Eris, John Bunker, THEPALMER, Esopus Spitzenberg, Normandy, The Atlantic, dessert, Hawkeye, folk, trees, McIntosh apple, pomologist, Russia, Tom Burford, genetic, United States, Maine, George Washington, rootstock, Old Testament, forebears, Thoreau, North America, Solomon, West, Far East, Heaven, Iowa, Dickinson, Elizabeth Coetzee, Thomas Jefferson, Peleus, Malus domestica, baking, Scandinavia, time, Granny Smith, McIntoshes—or, Cortland, grafted, orchardist, Bussey, agriculture, Winesaps, Pippin, seedling, Johnny Appleseed, breed, Europe, jay, transatlantic, Silk Road, extinct, Washington, France, Matthew Zuras, zest, Levant, Roxbury Russet, red color, Across Europe, Ludacrisp, Apple, Mount Vernon, metaphor, Photo, Wisconsin, peak, cider, dragons, Baldwin, fermentation, Monticello, Thetis, Dave Benscoter, taxonomically, Julius Caesar, soil, Iðunn, Virginia, hybrid, Celtic Britons, Zuras",2023-10-20,172.88,0.0

  ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" by Aretha Franklin
  ""Dancing On My Own"" by Robyn - ""Dancing On My Own""
  Every Song On The Long Shot Soundtrack
  ""Smoke 'em While You Can"" by Thunderfist - This song plays as Fred is infiltrating a neo-Nazi gathering, and as they attempt to haze him into the group with a hate symbol tattoo.
   ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" by Aretha Franklin - At the end of Long Shot, when Fred and Charlotte decide to pursue a relationship despite public opinion and political pressure, ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" plays as they seal their love with a kiss.
   In Long Shot, Fred doesn't meet the standards of whom Charlotte's campaign team and the general public think should be her significant other - however, the chemistry between Fred and Charlotte is undeniable, and they seek a relationship despite political constructs, the opinions of Long Shot's cast of supporting characters, and their own reservations of each other. Later, the song plays while Fred leaves a phone message for Charlotte admitting he's willing to change if it means their relationship will carry on.
  ""Chocolate"" by Big Boi and Troze - ""Chocolate"" plays during Fred and Charlotte's night out on the town, where they party and take drugs to take the edge off after the President pressures Charlotte to alter her political initiatives.
  ""Can't Do Without You"" by Caribou - ""Can't Do Without You"" plays during Fred and Charlotte's night out while they kiss underneath the fireworks.

   Cook had five catches for 79 yards, Gacayan had five for 56, and Cormier finished with 94 yards rushing on just seven carries as UMHB totaled 468 yards.

   Musk described a post on the platform instructing users on enabling the feature as an ""Early version of video & audio calling on X"".
   After rebranding Twitter as X, Musk signaled he would turn the platform into a super-app, offering a range of services from messaging and social networking to peer-to-peer payments.
   The latest functionality comes amid a series of new features and changes to the platform's core experience under Musk, who acquired the social media company nearly a year ago.
   Teasing the feature in August, Musk had said users would not need a phone number for the features, which will be available on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )'s iOS, Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL )'s Android and personal computers.

Elon Musk's X Corp. sued Media Matters on Monday, claiming the media watchdog group defamed the social-media company last week with a report that pro-Nazi posts were appearing next to ads by major brands.

 I wish only the best for humanity and a prosperous and exciting future for all.""

In a tweet Monday, X Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino said ""not a single authentic user"" saw pro-Nazi content next to the ads mentioned in Media Matters' article, and accused the group of manipulating its results.

 Following the Media Matters report, which was published soon after Musk appeared to endorse an antisemitic conspiracy theory in an X post, a number of companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), IBM Corp. (IBM), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Walt Disney Co. (DIS), suspended their advertising on X.

On Friday, Musk threatened a ""thermonuclear"" lawsuit against Media Matters and other critics. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claimed Media Matters ""knowingly and maliciously"" manufactured misleading images and portrayed them as if they were a typical user experience, and accused the organization of a ""smear campaign"" against X, the former Twitter.

 Even Disney, the traditional media giant that owns ESPN and ABC and is best positioned among Hollywood companies to compete for sports rights, filed an SEC 10K document Wednesday saying it will cut program spending across cable, broadcast, and streaming from $33 billion to $25 billion next year. In a Tuesday research note after meetings with West Coast entertainment executives, MoffettNathanson senior analyst Michael Nathanson said one takeaway was that “questions remain if we are finally seeing signs of the (sports rights) bubble starting to pop.”
  Industry sentiment suggests the NBA is increasingly well positioned for a lucrative renewal of its TV rights, the biggest package up for negotiations right now, Nathanson said. “While investors talk about all the sports rights a tech platform could capture by buying legacy media, assets, we are unsure exactly how big their appetite is for sports rights, and firmly believe these companies are focused on waiting for sports rights deals to expire and simply licensing what they want directly” Greenfield wrote.
   That's going to squeeze everyone else.”
  LightShed Partners' Rich Greenfield, in speculating about the uncertain future of Paramount Global, suggested in a note Tuesday that its admirable collection of sports rights won't be enough to get a tech giant to buy the entire company.

Vulcan used two huge engines developed by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space company during the first part of the mission, marking the debut in flight for those machines. The company needs to complete one more certification launch before it can begin those.
  Mark Peller, a vice president at ULA, said at a recent briefing that Vulcan is designed to offer both medium and heavy launch capacities, an indicator of how much mass would be flown, on a single vehicle.

But Gray knows how to direct a cacophonous action sequence, and the cat-and-mouse chase that plays out between Cyrus and Interpol officer Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in the canals of Venice is impressive and enjoyably stressful (I fear the wakes may sink the city faster).

  SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stocks stumbled and the dollar was near a one-month high on Wednesday as hawkish rhetoric from central bankers beat back bets of early interest rate cuts, while geopolitical worries kept risk sentiment in check.
   U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on Tuesday that while inflation was approaching the central bank's 2% goal, the Fed should not rush to lower interest rates until lower inflation can clearly be sustained.
   Waller's comments echoed sentiments of European central bankers, who have also pushed back against market expectations of early and steep rate cuts.

   Why did you become so – I don't want to say infatuated with – focused on small caps?
  KEITH McLACHLAN: Those who are new in South Africa to investing won't appreciate how vibrant the JSE was about 10/15 years ago when there was a small-cap listing boom, particularly on the part of the JSE called AltX. At the same time you could generate a lot of alpha in this portion of the market if you were willing to do the research and willing to carry some more risk than the market.
   How do you think young amateur investors, people who've just entered the job market and get their first pay cheque, their first bonus, and want to use that to invest and build a portfolio, how do you think they should view small caps as an investment option?

   On the social media network X, Elon Musk wrote: “The first human received an implant from @Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well.”
   It has also developed a robot to insert the implants because “the threads of our implant are so fine that they can't be inserted by the human hand.”
  Last June, Reuters estimated that Neuralink, which was founded in 2016, was already worth around $5bn (£3.9bn) based on privately traded shares.

sizable cuts in U.S. interest rates this year even if the kick off might now be a little later than first hoped.
   In a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.
   As a result, Fed fund futures for December have priced in a further 13 basis points of easing this year taking the total expected to 143 basis points.
   Likewise, Treasuries rallied strongly as 10-year yields dived 12 basis points to 3.91% in the wake of the Fed decision. The Federal Reserve committee's decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.

2024-02-06,"Myles Kritzinger, CEO of the newly established South African Multifamily Residential Rental Association (Samrra), shares his insights on why this
specialist sub-sector of real estate is booming in the US and Australia, and Samrra's aim to ‘further institutionalise' multifamily as a property investment class locally.
   “I think as part of an association like Samrra, where I can obviously support and help the growth of the story of multifamily in the asset class in the South African context, I'm very glad and happy to be a part of that.”
  “As an association, the big thing at the moment is to get the message out there, and to get the story around multifamily to the market, where it's a credible message – and I think a better-understood one in terms of what residential offers from a rental standpoint.”
  “I think there has largely been a misconception around the risks of multifamily residential – where the experiences of Covid and, as you mentioned, a few of the players operating in the space have demonstrated that multifamily is actually a low-risk credit-diversified investment opportunity.”
  “What we will be looking to do in the months to come is definitely to look to ‘roadshow' our association and its members – and what the broader asset class has to offer. I come from the IHS Group, International Housing Solutions, where I initially started, gosh, already back in 2013/14, so it feels like a very long, long time ago.”
  “I transitioned into the listed space when I took over as financial director of Transcend about six years or so ago, and then more recently, three years ago, took over as CEO.”
  “So I think when we looked at it as a group, again coming back to the objective of further institutionalising this asset class, the group felt that I was well positioned in terms of talking to the institutional market and understanding the requirements and the needs in terms of, I suppose, growing a multifamily [class] in a South African context.”
  “But, having said that, I suppose the big benefit with all of these things is that you've got access to great people and experienced people in that group. You did share quite a bit, but can you give us a little more insight about its potential for growth in South Africa, because it's certainly, as you mentioned, a small percentage currently in terms of an investment class?
  “When looking at what multifamily is, and then also what it offers, you've got to draw that into relief in the context of the South African property market. And I suppose as an investment class but also as a social need requirement there's huge, huge runway within South Africa – and also looking outside South Africa's borders into Africa as well.”
