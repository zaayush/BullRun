How to run


Reflections
What you learned
The complex relationship between news and stock performance: Even seemingly unrelated news can have significant ripple effects on investor sentiment and stock prices.
How to effectively analyze arrays of news databases to create the predictive model: We were overwhelmed by the news information; filtering the relevant parameters took a lot of time. After becoming familiar with the potential model structure, we were finally able to finalize the input parameters.
The importance of Data Visualization: Given our purpose of simplifying the investment experience for individual investors, the way we present data analysis is critical. We have been benchmarking other websites to produce effective data visualization. 

What questions/problems did you face:
Finding a free news API to get the database.
Finding a Stock Price API that is suitable for creating and training the predictive model.
